School taught us all the wrong lessons. 

They said: "Make it longer." 

Life says: "Make it shorter." 

They said: "Take your time." 

Life says: "You have seconds." 

They said: "Follow the rules." 

Life says: "Break them." 

Want proof? 

TikTok: 15 seconds 

Tweets: 280 characters 

Emails: 3 sentences 

Pitches: 30 seconds 

Attention spans: Shrinking 

The world moves fast. 

But here's what school never taught us: 

Success isn't about long papers. 

It's about quick action. 

That's why I created The $1,000 New Business Challenge. 

21 days. 

21 small actions. 

10 minutes per day. 

No fluff. 

No theory. 

No 5-page papers. 

Just rapid execution.
