okay so I actually got this recently this is uh it came too late for the video but I was saying yes to everything and this is one of the things that showed up this is a Magic Mouse case now just as our refresher this is Apple we're talking about the richest technology company in the world and this is the mouse they ship with their computers it's the best they could do somehow it's terrible it somehow has two fatal flaws one is that it's an ergonomic nightmare for anyone who doesn't have Babys sized hands but then two is when the battery finally dies the charge port is at the bottom so you can't use it while you just wait for it to charge it's hilarious so this company has made like a 3D printed plastic case for it you basically just slot it in and now it's better I mean the idea is it's giving you an arched shape to actually rest your hand it just turns out now there's kind of a cliff that your fingers hang off of and it introduces a slightly new different type of fatigue it is kind of weird I don't know there is a a bit of a cavity up here for a charging cable if you want to store it in there so for an extra 40 bucks now the mouse only has one fatal flaw two out of 10
