qF4vZxbSmjo,iPhone 16e Review: Who Are You?,The new iPhone 16e costs $599. Who is it for? Save 15% when you bundle a dbrand Prism and Grip case at ...,2025-02-27T02:00:39Z,6304617,206746,15211,"(soft mischievous music) - Hi, welcome to Honesty Wireless, the world's most honest salesman here. How can I help you today? - Hi. Yeah, so I'd like a
cheap new iPhone, please. - Cool. So unfortunately, the
iPhone SEs are out of style, but we do have iPhone 14s. I think that'll be perfect
for you every time. I'll get you started with that. - Actually, actually, I'd like a cheap, smallish iPhone with a
48-megapixel camera, specifically. - Okay. Well, then I can get you the
iPhone 15 to get started. Perfect. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, wait. Okay, so I would like a cheap, smallish iPhone with
a 48-megapixel camera, and I gotta have Apple Intelligence, so. - Okay. Nobody ever asked for that, but then I'll get you
with an iPhone 15 Pro. We got those on refurb. - Okay, so I have exactly $600 to spend on a cheap, smallish iPhone. I need a 48-megapixel camera.
I need Apple Intelligence. I need an OLED screen.
I heard that was good. And it's gotta have Face ID,
and I want that Action Button. So yeah. - Okay. No, yeah, that's still, an iPhone 15 Pro should actually be good for all of your needs. So yeah.
- And also, I hate high refresh rate, so it's gotta be 60 hertz. And MagSafe, I hate that
too. Don't want that. What? Who are you? (upbeat music) So this is the brand-new 2025 iPhone 16e. And this is not a budget phone anymore. So the SEs of the past used
to be definitively budget. This one is not. This
phone starts at $599. And Apple's storage upgrade prices are still ridiculous, as usual. So the phone that I happen to be holding and testing right now costs $900. So this is not a budget phone. It happens to be the cheapest
new iPhone available, but it's not cheap anymore, which makes it much harder to recommend. See, the iPhone SE for
the past two generations, even though it's been old body, new chip, it's been the easiest iPhone
to recommend for most people: to your parents, to kids, to random people getting
their first iPhone. To anyone who is randomly
upgrading from an old phone. It's just the cheapest
new iPhone, and it's fine. But those phones were $399 and $429. So at 599 bucks, this
phone that they've made, we just look at it differently now. And so I've been using this phone for the past week trying to figure out who I think I could actually
recommend to buy it, and I don't think there is one. (air whooshes) (device whirring) (air whooshing) The secret to making
the SE iPhone so cheap for years has been the parts bin strategy. Basically, taking parts that they've already spent
the money engineering and just frankensteining them together. And this is true again for this 16e. So this time it's mostly in
the body of the iPhone 14. So you've got your aluminum
build, your flat sides, your USB Type-C, even
IP68 water resistance, but then it's a new single
camera ring on the back. We'll get to that in a minute. And they've added the Action
Button to the left side too. Up at the front, it also still appears to be
straight from the iPhone 14. You've got your 6.1-inch screen
with a notch and Face ID. It definitely is just all
bringing the cheapest iPhone up to date with a more modern look. Again, remember, the last
one looked like this. So this is way better. It's not the brightest
display in the world. So once you get it out
into direct sunlight, it's a bit less visible than some other actually modern displays. And it's also still 60
hertz, which is still silly. But in general, it looks fine. But this is exactly where
the nickel and diming begins. So you've got this whole
family of iPhone 16s now: 16e, 16s, and 16 Pros. Good, better, best, if
you wanna call it that. And so the cheapest iPhone, they've had to take stuff out of it to get it down to this price. Some of the stuff they've taken
out, not that big of a deal. Some of the stuff they've taken out, kind of harder to swallow. So here's one. The headline is that it gets
the newest silicon straight from the flagship iPhone 16: the A18 chip. Great. Asterisk, this is not
exactly the same silicon. This chip has one less GPU core. Pretty classic binning.
Not that big of a deal. This happens all the time. We just saw the Oppo Find N5. That also has a binned Snapdragon 8 Elite with only seven cores
instead of the typical eight. It's barely a footnote, honestly. You'll only really maybe
notice it with intense gaming with the few games that are
actually that taxing on the GPU. But aside from that, it's really good. This formula has worked in the past, and it's always ended up being, on paper, one of the most powerful
phones in its price bracket. And that's still true. It still is. So a binned CPU, GPU? Fine. Fine cut. Another cut, colors. There's no colors. There's only
matte black or matte white. And this whole design
here really is actually, it's super clean and also super boring. There's a complete lack of
text anywhere on the back. And then, honestly, the
relatively small camera bump is a bit refreshing, honestly. But yeah, if you want any
type of color on this phone, you'll need a case or a skin to get that. It's funny, the last two
iPhone SEs I reviewed were both bright red,
which I thought was fun. And now there's actually no
more Product Red products anywhere in Apple's lineups. That was that program that
was the red-colored products where the proceeds would go
to help support AIDS programs. I kind of wonder what happened to that. So colors, that's another cut. Okay. No MagSafe in a 16e. (groans) That one feels a little worse. So obviously, the last SE
also didn't have MagSafe. But that was three years ago. And MagSafe has now become a staple of the iPhone experience,
at least I thought. And this is supposed to
be the cheapest version of a modern iPhone. But no, this phone has just slow, first-gen Qi wireless charging
that maxes out at 7.5 watts. And since there's no magnets to make sure you get alignment right, if you're just a little bit
off, it can be painfully slow. This week I had it on my
desk charger for, like, half an hour, and it gained
0% while just getting warmer. I don't have to remind
you of the downsides of early wireless charging. Of course, if you really,
really want MagSafe on your 16e, there's nothing stopping
you from getting a case. So I've got one from
channel sponsor dbrand here, their Grip Case. And it's got the magnets in the case, like we've seen in the Android world. So perfect alignment every time. Yeah, I guess Apple didn't want SE users who only spend $600 to be able
to get MagSafe accessories on the back of their phone without a case. Oh, and while we're at it, if you want to get full protection, dbrand also supports the 16e with their easy-to-install
Prism 2.0 screen protector. So you can actually save 15% if you bundle a Prism with a Grip Case. So I'd recommend that route
if you're buying both. Chem them both out at dbrand.com/bundle. Either way, the iPhone has
been the phone with magnets for so long in my head that I just feel like
it's super disappointing to not have them in a new $600 iPhone. But now we gotta talk about that camera. So there's a new single
camera on the back. I actually think the whole good, better, best thing with the iPhones where, like, the cheap one has one camera, the middle one has two cameras, and then the best one has three cameras, it actually feels pretty natural and, like, an
easy-to-understand hierarchy. But please understand
that this single camera is also not the same as the
primary camera on the iPhone 16. It's 48 megapixels, just
like the 16 and 16 Pro, but that's only part of the story. It is actually a much smaller sensor with inferior stabilization. So that manifests itself into just a very
different look for photos. It kind of reminds me a lot actually of the a-series Pixel phones. It's not necessarily a worse
look. During daytime, anyway. It's just different. Way less shallow depth of
field, a lot less natural bokeh. There's still plenty of sharpness and typical iPhone colors and saturation, but then the image definitely
gets much more quickly soft as the light starts to go away, because the tiny sensor's just
not getting as much light. It gets less likely to freeze action and more likely to kick in night mode. Also, missing the second
lens means you're missing cinematic mode, spatial video, and macros. So I just think, in general,
if you're the type of person that cares a lot about
the camera on your phone, you can see the clear steady progression of better iPhone equals better camera. But this one, honestly, for
its price range, is fine. Now, there's a couple other smaller things that the iPhone 16e also doesn't have. Wi-fi 6E and Wi-fi 7
support is one of them. Honestly, not a huge deal to me. It would be nice for future proofing. Other phones do have it. But a lot of people will never notice because they also will
never update their router. There's also no ultrawide band, so you cannot do the precision finding with any AirTags or anything like that. There also is the Action Button, but there is no camera
control on this phone. But honestly, I don't think
anyone's dying for that. But the sneaky X factor with this phone is they've actually introduced a new part, and that's Apple's first
in-house-designed cellular modem, called C1. So there were some rumors about this. I remember from years back, Apple spent literally a
billion dollars acquiring part of Intel's modem business. So fast-forward six years
and this is the first iPhone that doesn't have a Qualcomm modem in it. Apple's replaced it with their own for 4G, 5G, GPS, and satellite. Now, they've had a lot of success with the vertical
integration thing lately. We just saw this with, you know, Apple silicon replacing
all the Intel chips that used to be in MacBooks. So I think the question
people are wondering is, is this the Apple silicon of modems? And I think the short answer is you probably won't
really notice anything. But that's actually a good thing. Like, I did speed tests
in different places. Didn't find anything really too dramatic. Gripping the phone
differently in different ways also doesn't seem to matter at all, because as far as I can tell, the antennas aren't really changed. There is no millimeter wave 5G
support with this modem yet. That's something to keep in mind. Though, again, a lot of people
will also never notice that. What is sneaky, important,
though, is modems can be or have been really big
power draws in phones. Like, you've probably noticed this. If you're in an area with, like, kind of crappy cellular signal
and your phone is, like, hunting and switching back
and forth between 4G and 5G, that can drain your battery a lot. And the main claimed improvement of the C1 really is actually efficiency, which I love to hear. It's funny, SE iPhones
of the past have always also been small 'cause
they're using older bodies. So small body, but modern processor that draws a lot of power. So battery life was just not
a strong suit of those phones. But this 16e is a modern-sized big phone, and then it has this new, more efficient modem that is
actually physically smaller and makes room for a
physically larger battery. So battery life on this been really good in my week of using it. Literally on par with my 16 Pro. It wireless charges way slower, but it's a really good battery. So two main thoughts here on the C1. One, if Apple's been
working on this for years, it actually makes sense
that they would debut it in a relatively low-stakes, lower-volume phone like the 16e. You know, iron out any kinks or figure out if there's
any issues with it, and then when it's a big deal in the iPhone 17 series later
this year, should be all set. But also, two, maybe this is, like, the other missing piece
that will help enable Apple to make this, like, super thin iPhone Air
everyone's talking about. Apple's always wanted to
make super thin stuff, but battery life always
suffers when you do that. So maybe this alongside that silicon carbide battery
tech could enable them to make an iPhone that's super thin whose battery doesn't suck. Maybe. We'll see. But overall, the iPhone 16e, the more I think about this phone, the more it feels like
it exists specifically to push you up to an iPhone 16, in Apple's classic price ladder. You get enticed by this base price, but then the next rung on the ladder is only a small jump away, and it's sitting there with all of its shiny extras like
MagSafe and an ultrawide camera. Here's the problem, though. This phone fits the price ladder, sure, but it doesn't fit the price tag. Like, let's be real. Everything that's wrong with
this phone is the price. Now, I'm sure tariffs, the
R&D of this new C1 ship, the extra RAM to support
Apple Intelligence, inflation maybe even, like, all these things to some extent contribute to the higher price of this phone. Maybe Apple also plans on increasing the entire
iPhone 17 lineup price too. But this is the same identity crisis that the Pixel a series just had. I don't know if you remember that, but that budget phone came out, but the slightly older, more premium phone was still
a better deal for most people because it was on a
slight discount already. So you could get a
refurbished iPhone 15 Pro for $600 today. I could argue that every
single person considering the 16e should start by
considering the 15 Pro. It's just, everything about it is better. The screen, it's way
brighter, more visible. It's a higher refresh rate. Triple cameras instead of one
camera. Same battery life. It's only one year older. It's got Apple Intelligence. It's just, you should just
start with that phone instead. And I actually feel like I know
what Apple's answer would be if I asked them, ""Who
should buy this phone?"" 'Cause if you go to
their site for the 16e, the built-in compare tool
only shows comparisons versus iPhone 12 and 12 Mini and iPhone 11 and the older SEs. So basically, if you're somebody with one of these older phones, then this would be a perfectly
fine upgrade for you. You get that more modern design, the new chip, Apple
Intelligence, and you're set. And they'd be right, it's not a bad phone
for those people at all. It's just the new price
does not match the phone. (upbeat music) What? Who are you? (upbeat music)","I wont recommend any iphone to anyone :) | Dropped my 12 Mini in a lake today. We didn’t find it. Picked one of these up at the nearest store for free. (Had some extra loyalty points for some time already.)

If you remove the price problem it’s actually fine, and I never used wireless charging or MagSafe even with the 12 mini anyway. | your dad | Speedster | What is the weather app showing, it looks excellent. min 11:15 | I am iPhone user and don’t give f about all other new phones coming out from apple. All I want is a folding phone running iOS. | Its no much against honor x9c | I remember when this was the price of the top-tier flagship phone.  

It appears that my upgrade cycles will continue to occur every 5-7 years. | I feel like I'm a perfect target for this phone. It sounds like the beginning of a line-up that's great to me.

First of all, I'm not in the USA. There's no official Apple refurbished market here. There are refurbished iphones handled by third-parties, but the quality isn't usually the same as if it was refurbished by Apple themselves. 

I own an iphone 12, bought at launch, whose battery I replaced about five/six months ago, and I'm not looking to replace the phone in 2025, but I'm planning to do it within the next two years.
I don't care for the camera (I find its post-processing awful), I don't care for magsafe (I use a non-magsafe wireless charger - four years, it's never been an issue!), but I care with having oled (the main reason I picked the 12 instead of the 11), Face ID and the operating system itself.
While I don't find the 16E specifically tempting to me, because I'm not looking to replace my phone now, I'll probably love, for instance, a 17E or 18E, when the time comes.

So, spending €739 on this or €989 on the 16?
I'd definitely appreciate not spending over €900 on an iphone again. | We wanted an iPhone 13 Mini with A18 for AI. Even make it a one lense camera on the bach. That's fine."
SAb4zRyxrD4,Samsung Galaxy S25/Ultra Impressions: What Happened?,It's the same picture. Get an S25 Ultra case that'll never yellow at https://dbrand.com/ghost Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: ...,2025-01-22T18:00:39Z,5400294,153543,14416,"(transition whooshing) (transition whooshing) (upbeat music) - Okay, so sometimes new phones come out, and people are basically like, ""Oh, it's the same as last year. It's basically last year's
phone with a new name. Nothing changed."" And that's mostly exaggeration. There are a few things usually that are at least worth talking about. But with this phone, I can honestly say there is nothing. Nothing dramatically new about the S25s. So welcome to your first look at the Samsung Galaxy S25 Series, S25, S25+ and S25 Ultra, plus my take on what's going
on with Samsung right now. So right off rip, very
familiar on the outside, right? With the standard phones,
without the new colors, I honestly don't think I
could tell the difference between this and last year. Same 6.2 inch and 6.7 inch
sizes, same flat sides, same cold design. If you really wanna get
into the weeds about it, they moved the 5G antenna
to the other side, up at the top there. So that's your tell that
you're holding the new model. But really all the changes
are gonna be on the inside. It's rocking the new Snapdragon
8 Elite for Galaxy chip, with a slightly upgraded vapor chamber, and 12 gigs of base RAM
across the board now. And then the Ultra, so the Ultra actually did get a little bit of a cosmetic update. Can you tell the difference? Just kidding. This is the S24 Ultra. This is the S25 ultra. Now, can you tell what they did? Same battery size, same
port and button layout, but this time, the sides are
just a bit more squared off and rectangular, and the rings around the camera
bumps are all a bit bigger. So the bezels are a little
bit smaller on the front, about 15% smaller. So there you go, a little more screen. That counts as a design update, I guess. But internally, Snapdragon
8 Elite for Galaxy again and a 40% larger vapor chamber. And it's also upgraded to the newest Gorilla Glass at the front. And there's a new 50
megapixel ultra-wide camera, replacing the outgoing 12 megapixel. Otherwise, the rest of the cameras and really the rest of the specs in total, from the battery to the
brightness, are all the same. Everything else new here is software. So we'll get to that in a second. But you remember when phones
used to do just the S update every other year? They would have a big jump
and then a small jump. And that small jump was like a
spec bump in the same design. This is the purest form of
just going back to that. Like this is basically a Galaxy S24S. And on one hand, how can
you blame them, right? Like the S24 line sold
really well for them. People loved those phones. The Ultra won my phone
of the year last year, so stick with the formula, if
it's not broke, don't fix it. But on the other hand, that phone was also really
similar to the year before that, which was similar to the year before that. So after a while, the design
does feel kind of stale. But like I said, most of
what's new is software, and specifically, you
guessed it, AI stuff. So there's a long list
of new Galaxy AI features launching on the S25 series, which have a range of
usefulness, I'll put it that way. So the biggest one is this new assistant that's triggered when you
hold the power button, and it looks like this. Now you can actually see it
says, ""Ask Gemini,"" in the box, but it's not actually pure Gemini. It's more of a hybrid of
Google Gemini and Bixby. So combining the best of both worlds. And obviously, Gemini is
gonna be better at most stuff and it will default to that, but some of Bixby's
ability to reach into apps and perform in-app actions is also here. So it's fascinating watching this work because for most of the stuff you ask, it just is Gemini, right? Ask some facts or some current events. But every once in a while, you can ask it something specific, like to add an event to your calendar, and then you can see it
take action and dig in and actually do it for you instead of just opening an
app and asking you to do it. And that's genuinely useful. Some people are gonna build
their whole lives around that, I'm sure. It's kind of funny. It doesn't seem like
you're able to pull it up with a voice command trigger. Like you can't just say,
""Bixby,"" and it comes up, or, ""Google,"" because it's both. So that's kind of weird. You do have to trigger it by
holding down the power button. It's basically Gemini
with some extensions. Anyway, what else? So there's another one
now called AI Select. So instead of the regular text selection, let's say you wanna select something a little more complicated, you swipe over from the edge panel or take a screenshot and invoke AI Select, and it'll use context to let you select
whatever's on your screen and do something more useful with it. So if there's a bunch of text
and you're reading an article, AI Select will surface writing tools, and then you can summarize that text, or at least the text that's
currently on your page. Or if you're watching a video,
you can pull up AI Select, and there's a tool to make a GIF of whatever's on your screen. So you can select the video
and a few seconds of it, and make a GIF super easily. I could have sworn they had a way of doing this with the
S Pen not too long ago and I just forgot about it, but shows you how much I used it. But, yeah, now making a GIF
is easy whenever you want. There's also now natural
language processing in the Settings and Gallery search. So you can just search
using regular sentences, and it'll actually find
what you're looking for by understanding you. That I think is pretty cool. It's useful. I know some less
technically-inclined people will get a lot of use out of this. And there's also some smaller stuff, like this Now brief widget, which is supposed to give
you AI-curated information you need to know at that moment. Certain useful things in the
morning versus the afternoon. And they also made an
equivalent audio eraser tool to what Google had just
added to the Pixel phones like a year or two ago. So now any video you have on your phone, whether you took it in
the camera app or not, you can clean up the audio
and isolate the voice by removing crowd noise
or background noise or wind or whatever with
a single button press. I wanna try and see how good it is. A lot of these AI features, it's taught me, if
you've heard this before, you know, they're cool
if they actually work, but it's debatable how much you're actually going to use them and how much value they
bring to this phone. But then the real kicker is, and this is technically a good thing, but Samsung has been really good about software updates lately. They're promising like seven
years of software updates on their newest flagships, which means that if most of
the new stuff on this phone is this software in the AI stuff, I didn't really see a whole lot of reason why most of it isn't going
to also be on the S24 in a couple weeks. So they're decently useful features. Some of them clever, some of them work offline
without an internet connection. Some of them power users will love, but it's obviously hard to use it as a reason to upgrade to this phone if you hold a decently new phone that already has some of
these features coming. The new One UI 7 that
I've been using in beta on my S24 Ultra for a few weeks, which is this whole, you
know, software overhaul and aesthetic code of
paint for Samsung's phones, I think that makes a bigger difference than any of the hardware stuff that they're changing about S25. Like you could give me right
now that new ultra-wide on the Ultra and I might not notice. You could give me the
slightly bigger screen, I might not notice. The new chip, maybe. But the UI, the software, it is a refreshed look
like across the board, fresh coat of paint with these aesthetics. And also, yes, some iOS-inspired features tucked in there too. The new lock screen
customization in particular. I mean, that's right along the same lines as the iOS lock screen update
we got a few years ago. So anyway, the S25 line is
absolute textbook spec bump. Zero risk for Samsung. And because of that, you could argue, probably zero risk for the
target demographic too. Now, make sure you get subscribed for the full reviews for these phones because they could
technically still surprise me. I know there's no IP69 and
no silicon carbide battery and no ultra-fast charging
and no brighter display, but is the Snapdragon
8 Elite for Galaxy chip going to be a big enough
bump that we notice it and maybe we don't even
need a much bigger battery? You know, is the new ISP on that chip gonna breathe new life into these cameras? All of this is TBD, so
I need to check it out. I also need to see if this new S Pen did in fact lose Bluetooth because there are rumors about that, and I didn't have time to check. But, yeah, there's still some wiggle room for us to form opinions
about these phones. So if you're thinking of
grabbing an S25 Ultra, you're probably already
considering which clear case to get because the only way you
can tell it from the S24 is by a new colorway. The thing about clear cases though is they all eventually start
to turn like yellow, like this, with the plastic, which just looks gross. So channel's sponsor, dbrand,
with their new Ghost Case 2.0 guarantees that their case
will never turn yellow. Like they literally have guaranteed that if it ever does turn yellow, they'll replace it for free. And I believe them too. One of the things I've
always liked about dbrand is that they always go out of their way to do right by their customers. So to give you an example, the other thing with clear cases is they can also get
scratched pretty easily, which was a problem with the
original Ghost Case at launch. So dbrand actually went out of their way to develop a new super
scratch-resistant 2.0 version of the case from the ground up and offered it as a free replacement to everyone who bought
the original Ghost Case, like 100% free. So if you want to get
a zero yellowing case and to support a company that consistently does
right for their customers, I will leave a link to
the S25 Ultra Ghost Case down below in the description. Either way, that's been it. Thanks for watching. Catch you out to the next one. Peace. (upbeat music)","This is why I buy a new ultra every 3 or 4 years | What about S25..? | Buy samsung and get greenline 💚 for free | S21 ultra was the perfect phone design for me | I bet more people enjoy the Bluetooth s pen than the AI bullshit. | Looks like infinix 40 series | Can someone talk about the display and eyestrain? Mine gives me eye pain and headaches when set to 120hz but not on 60hz. I've seen people complaining on reddit also. It's a real issues as I have just bought my second unit to test it and I have the exact same symptoms. | Did the S24u get all the AI features that are on the S25u? | So I'm guessing I would notice a massive difference upgrading to S25 from S21 FE. | Unpopular opinion? I owned S24 Ultra for 1 month only.
That phone hurts my palm so bad. Too wide, too boxy, too heavy. Even read some reviews that it could puncture their jeans. I couldnt endure the discomfort. And I came from most of the Note series so I am familiar with the feel of boxy phones, but s24U is just uncomfortable to use. Even using a case did not solve my problems. Sold it. Bought s25U and the difference is night and day.

S25U is A LOT smoother, faster, and very comfortable to hold. The ""hated"" curved frame is GREAT. The ""hated"" reduced weight is PERFECT. Like i could use this phone for 3-4 yrs. Almost perfect phone if it wasnt for the spen downgrade. But its fine for me. As i wont be using the spen shutter everyday, but id be holding my phone everyday ofcourse.

And the speakers... I owned a Note 20 prior to s24U and my Note 20 sounded a lot better. S24U's speakers sound so flat. I hated it so bad. Whereas the S25U probably has the best phone speaker as of this moment. Really punchy bass and great overall.

And oh, S24U overheats as well. I play games on my phone and even setting the graphics to minimum and low fps, it still overheats so bad. Whereas the S25U does not AT ALL. 

I was just so disappointed with the S24U that I didnt feel the upgrade and I came from only the Note 20 at that.

Maybe you cannot see huge improvements or drastic innovations on the S25U (and same, spen is a let down)... but samsung FIXED the things I HATED with my s24U. Hate is an understatement for such an expensive phone. Those things made me let go of my s24U and try the s25U. 

And I am just so happy with my S25U.:)
Titanium Gray variant is such a lovely color as well.

Hope people would just stop this train hate for the s25U.
It is an AMAZING PHONE. A LOT BETTER THAN S24U."

smartphones for all of 2025. So even if this phone isn't for you, there's gonna be a lot more phones like it that are really good, which is sick. So those three things are the
incredible battery, the chip, and the record-breaking display. So let's just get right into this battery. It's an easy place to start. This is the OnePlus 13, and it has a 6,000 milliamp-hour battery. This perfectly reasonably sized, kind of slim phone
without being super thick has a battery literally
double the capacity of the Galaxy S8. It's kind of nuts, actually. So if you've been keeping
track of phone battery sizes for the past few years, you might be wondering what is happening? Like, how is this jump all of a sudden happening
with a bunch of phones? Like the Galaxy S24 Ultra from last year, this, you know, full-size mega flagship, has an enormous 5,000
milliamp-hour battery, but yet suddenly there's
a bunch of new phones in the past few weeks that are not thicker that have a 5,500, 6,000, even
7,000 milliamp-hour battery. Like, what is happening? And the answer is silicon carbon. These new batteries, without
getting too technical, they are still lithium-ion batteries, but with a new silicon carbon anode or a mixture of silicon and graphite. But the results have really
spoken for themselves. They've been bangers. More energy density, obviously, but also enabling faster charging and a greater range of
operating temperatures. So pretty much great all the way around. It's also pretty new, so this is a bit of an
expensive technology. So it's gonna be in
flagships mostly to start, but this is the first part of a wave of new phones shipping with them. This will be great for small
phones having better batteries. This will be great for folding phones like we've seen already
with the Honor Magic V2, which is impossibly thin but has 5,000 milliamp-hours of capacity. And that is absolutely
how we got this OnePlus 13 being thinner and lighter
than the OnePlus 12, yet having a 10% larger battery. It was honestly hard to
find a day to challenge it and try to drain the whole thing. The truth is, even with
my high brightness use, plenty of multitasking, this is a two-day phone at 120 hertz, and I turned it up to high resolution. I had days of, like, hours
of, you know, GPS navigation, high brightness, a whole
bunch of stuff happening, Bluetooth streaming, a whole ton, and I'd end the day with
six hours of screen-on time, and I'd still have 35% battery left. So I basically can't kill it in a day. It's sick. But when it finally does get low, it has 80-watt fast charging, so it can go from zero
to 100 in 36 minutes, and it supports 50-watt wireless charging with the right charging pad. This is the best that
smartphone batteries have been since the beginning of
the modern smartphone. I promise this is a great battery, and there's gonna be a lot more like it. That's the exciting part. Hell yes! So that's number one, the battery. Number two is this new
chip inside, as well. This is the Snapdragon 8
Elite chip in this phone. And, you know, this new chip comes out every year from Qualcomm, and a bunch of us flagships use it. And typically, we see, you
know, 5% improvements here, 10% improvements there if we're lucky, and that's respectable. But this year the improvement
over last year's best has been way bigger. It has a 31% higher CPU clock speed. It scored 36% higher on
the AnTuTu benchmark, 44% higher on the single-core Geekbench. It jumps up 14% on 3DMark. Like, this thing is putting
up Wilt Chamberlain numbers; I'm loving it. Now, if you're just opening up Instagram or flipping through emails, it kind of sounds like none
of this is gonna matter, and you'd mostly be right. But I love to see this
type of jump on both power and efficiency because it
means if you're pushing a chip, it's been shown to hold high frame rates and high power outputs for
longer without throttling. But if you aren't gaming and you are just bouncing
around casual apps or scrolling Blue Sky
or emailing or whatever, it turns out your battery
efficiency gets much better, too. So this chip has been
great in a couple of phones that it started to show
up with late last year: ROG Phone 9 Pro, Red Magic 10 Pro, great performers, great gaming phones, but now it's gonna also start to show up in regular flagships. I'm pretty sure Galaxy S25
lineup's gonna have this chip, and it's gonna be great, too. So lots more phones to
also have that this year. So number one is the battery; it's great. Number two is the chip; it's great. Number three, last but not
least, is around the front, and it's this display. Holy nits! So I called this a
record-breaking display earlier, which might not mean much
because, you know, every year there's been a new record-breaking phone with the highest max nits. This is another one on that streak. 1,600 nits in high brightness mode, 4,500 nits peak brightness. And apparently, this is
the world's first display that's gotten an A++ from DisplayMate, whatever that means. I feel like I'm getting
DXOMark flashbacks here. What you really need to know
is this is a big display that looks really good all of the time, and it achieves that because, on paper, it absolutely does not miss. It's 6.82 inches corner to corner; QHD+ resolution, so it's nice and sharp; 120-hertz LTPO. It's mostly flat with,
like, just the very edges curving over just slightly. So I can forgive that. It has great viewing angles. And it just gets insanely
bright from corner to corner, and it can get super dim, as well. Plus, it has 2,160 hertz
high-frequency PWM dimming for those with sensitive eyes. And there's an ultrasonic
fingerprint reader underneath that's crazy fast. And it also has a new glove
mode for increased sensitivity while wearing thin gloves
and Aqua Touch 2.0, which does a great job at
keeping the screen responsive when there's water on it, which a lot of older phones struggle with. The peak brightness
number, the 4,500 nits, you know, it's an
impressive, very big number, but it doesn't really mean that much. It can't do that on all
of the pixels at once. And also the OnePlus
12 had the same number. But it's more just about the
crazy full-screen brightness. If you're out in the sun taking pictures, or if it's up in your dash, like, this screen gets insanely bright, and it's surrounded by basically no bezels that are even all the way around. What more could you ask for from a screen? So, look, I'm excited for
a bunch of other phones to also be coming out this year with the same impressive big
three that this phone has it. They can have this awesome
battery, this great chip, and an incredible display. But what you may have also noticed is that is three of my five
pillars of a great smartphone. The other two being build
quality and cameras. And this phone does pretty
good with those also. So I think the design
and build is pretty nice. This is good hardware. There's three colors to pick from. And they do this thing
where the base version, which is 900 bucks, is only
available in the black, but then the upgraded one for 1,000 bucks you can get in any color, including this nice blue
vegan microfiber leather. It's kind of soft to the
touch, and I like it. But there's also still an alert
slider on the flatter sides, which is a crowd favorite. I personally use it every day. The vibration motor inside is super good; it's really precise. And OnePlus has also hilariously
leveled up their IP rating, their certification for
water and dust resistance. It's not IP68; it's IP69. It's nice. Which means it can be not just submerged but also can sustain
high-pressure water jets at extreme temperatures, which is crazy. And it's also funny because
I remember a few years ago, OnePlus not wanting to pay
for IP certification at all. So now they're on the total opposite end. This phone can survive the laundry or being in the dishwasher
if that happens to you. Now, there's no Qi2 magnets
built into this phone, but I really like what
they've done with their cases. So they've got these official cases that have magnet rings in them, and they are basically the
exact same diameter as MagSafe. So now this phone with this case on it works with all of my MagSafe accessories. And I know that might
not seem like a big deal since most people buying this phone, you know, don't already have an iPhone and a bunch of iPhone
accessories lying around. But what it does do is basically unlock a whole world of
accessories for this phone. So with this case on, I've been using all my MagSafe
phone mounts in the car or any MagSafe charger or dock. They all work and just lock
right in firmly with the magnet. It's great. Maybe the only design
downside that I don't like is the camera bump is kinda
awkwardly slightly to one side, but that's not a huge deal. Speaking of cameras, though,
that's the other pillar. And this phone has a solid set of cameras. It's definitely not its strength. And this is kind of,
you've seen this before. This is the OnePlus story,
where they have fast phones, super smooth, great
charging, and all that, it's just the cameras are a
notch below other flagships. It's not a bad camera; it's just if you're gonna have an awesome, specced-out flagship but also
undercut the other flagships, then you gotta save a
little money somewhere. So the OnePlus 13's primary camera is the 50-megapixel Sony LYT-808 sensor with an f/1.6 aperture, essentially the same as the OnePlus 12. It is clearly... Look, it's gathering a lot of light, and the pictures during daytime and in nice conditions are really nice. It's even good for a
little soft depth of field with close-up subjects. And it does a good job
of freezing moving action and has good autofocus. It's just that performance
drops extra hard when the light goes away, which feels like an obvious statement. It's like saying a tire loses traction when the ground is wet, but
it's just a little worse than other competing flagships here. So it gets a little softer, gets a little HDR-y
more often with lights, and is definitely a victim of the make-every-dark-photo-look-bright
syndrome that we've observed in a
lot of phones in the past. Rarely is anything
actually in a deep shadow with this type of processing. And then there's also a
50-megapixel ultra-wide and a 50-megapixel, 3X
tri-prism telephoto camera, which offers some space
savings over a periscope zoom, but that's about it. And their performance in the dark is worse than the main camera. Video quality is definitely
passable, though. I like that basically every
new flagship phone now can shoot 4K60 from all three lenses, and this one can also shoot
8K30 from the main camera. This is the fifth generation of this OnePlus/Hasselblad partnership. And I remember when it first
got announced back in the day and people were wondering
if this is gonna be anything special or if it
was more along the same lines of what we've seen from,
like, Sony and Zeiss or Xiaomi and Leica. And to be honest, apart from, you know, some portrait mode stuff and the orange shutter button and a few tweaks to their pro mode, honestly, it's turned out to
be right in line with those. There wasn't some dramatic
reinventing of color science or suddenly a huge
revolutionary new sensor, but it's just a little
bit better than before. It's fine. I mean, people, again,
you're not buying this phone just for this camera,
but it's not a disaster. It'll hold up, and it'll be fine. Now, something you might have noticed, AI is not yet one of my
pillars of a great smartphone. It's not really close to the list yet, but it is in some of this OS. There are some features with AI built-in; in the camera and some
operating system stuff. But honestly, the OS is more important. You could argue that could be a pillar, and I think some people will
buy this phone just for the OS. And I think they'd be right. OxygenOS 15 is still so fast and smooth and brings Android 15 features and a tiny bit of a coat of
fresh paint over a lot of things along with some, shall we
say, familiar elements. Like they added this little
Dynamic Island copycat feature. So, hey, if you liked
Apple's Dynamic Island, well, you'll feel right at
home with the OnePlus 13. They're actually called
Live Alert capsules, but it also literally shows up in settings if I search Island. So (chuckles) I think they
know what they're doing. But anytime music is playing
or if you have a hotspot or a screen recording going on, this little bubble pops up
around the selfie camera, and then you can tap it to bring up a card with the controls for that activity, and then you can always long press to jump into the app itself. So look, if you're gonna copy stuff, copy the good stuff, right? Also, I have to at least take a second, and I don't know how
to feel about this yet. Maybe I'm curious what
your takes are on this. But there's this whole genre of phone testing videos I've seen mostly on Twitter
where all they really do is they just open and close apps super, super fast, a
bunch of them in a row, just to test the animations like this. And a part of me is like, what? That's not how anyone uses their phones. Like, who cares? I wouldn't have known if
my phone passed that test or failed, whatever. But also, OnePlus has
specifically seen those tests and optimized this phone,
changed the animations, to do really well on that test now. So here's the Galaxy S24 Ultra doing this and the OnePlus 13. I promise it's not something I would take into consideration
when buying a phone, and I don't think I'd even
notice it for everyday stuff, but I guess it's impressive
that they've done it. They've optimized this animation chain. Thanks? Honestly, though, as a whole,
OxygenOS on this phone, it's gonna be pretty familiar to anyone who's used any previous
OnePlus phones or Oppo phones with a couple AI features
sprinkled in now. Like, I still think Circle
to Search is awesome. There's also an AI editor
in the stock camera app now with things like AI Unblur
and Reflection Eraser, and Detail Booster, some of
which work okay sometimes, but also other times they're
still very obviously AI and not that good, and all of which require an
internet connection to work. And there's also some writing features that can do things like summarizing or adjusting tone or proofreading text, but it only works in
the OnePlus Notes app, which is a fine app, but
it would've been nice if it worked in other places, too. And it also requires
an internet connection. They usually call me a bit of a skeptic on a lot of these AI features
actually being useful. But in general, like I said, the software, smooth, super fast. It's really good. And it will be a reason why
some people would buy this phone over, say, a Vivo flagship, for example. Well, that and the price. But yeah, OnePlus trying
to undercut other flagships by being slightly cheaper than them. We've seen it before; that's their formula, and
they're sticking to it. But I'm excited about the
fact that everyone else can also stick to their formula this year, and it still means we're gonna
get much better batteries, chips, and displays across the board. So I think we're winning here. Sick. Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace. (groovy R&B music)","Ok just got mine yesterday.  Upgrading from a OnePlus 7pro.  This is completely different.  Gonna take me some time to get used to.  But I am excited to see what it's capable of.   

One question though, is there a screen protector on the phone? Or what is it, should I put on the screen protector I ordered? | The Silicon carbon battery is only 10% greater in capacity? Disappointing...  I hope this technology improves in the future! | I had 5T and it's NFC didn't work, dirt caused charging work only on original cable etc
Otherwise rugged long lasting phone | 0-100.
Not even gonna add any further text.
Y'all know the context. | All nice but you still use apple iPhone and workbooks 😂 | I have an s24 ultra and iPhone 16 pro and got this after some camera blind tests and I'm picky as heck and I can tell you one plus 13 is hands down the best camera. Especially in focus, shutter lag, and balance of the photos. My wife and I switched immediately after the first day to one plus. We have kids and this phone is the only one that would take clear and in focus shots of them running every single time.  The OS is super easy and I actually enjoy it better than iPhone and it's similar to the s24 ultra. New favorite phone. | Hi. Which one is better as an overall. This or or iqoo 13? | Switching from iPhone 11 to the Oneplus 13, this phone has one major deal breaker, the photo gallery doesn't have search function like it does on IOS. You can't search through photos by description. the keyboard sucks, and it definitely is not on par with the iphone in terms of speed. The price tho is definitely a lot cheaper. The camera is okay but again nowhere near an iphone 😅 | I decided to go to oneplus instead of upgrading to the Samsung galaxy s25 Ultra this year. And man.. all I can say is I LOVE THIS ONEPLUS 13 🔥  definitely recommend. The only annoying thing (at first)  is launching apps from the SmartSideBar. Equivalent to the side panel on Galaxy. When you launch apps they launch in window mode. Not full screen. However... this and a few other things at first feel bad. But once you understand why it does that. You learn to appreciate the functions of Oxygen OS. Needless to say this phone grew on me instantly and the features are amazing. Won't be going back to Samsung. In fact I look forward to yearly upgrades with the oneplus traditional lower prices for flagship phones. 🔥 | Does it has WiFi calls? Thanks 👍🏻"
z19HM7ANZlo,The M4 Mac Mini is Incredible!,The new $599 M4 Mac Mini is really good. In more than one way. MKBHD Merch: http://shop.MKBHD.com Apple Mac Mini M4: ...,2024-11-07T14:00:39Z,6472812,173001,8632,"(box clunks) (tape tearing) (chilled lo-fi music) (wrap rustling) (upbeat electronic music) - So usually, one crazy thing
about a new piece of tech is enough to get my attention, just something out of
the ordinary about it. But this new Mac mini has three things about it that are insane. So instead of having an event this year, Apple decided to do a bunch
of press releases in a row for the last week of October to update their whole Mac lineup to M4. And one of them was for this new Mac mini. Now, a lot of us might not give too much thought to the Mac mini, like, yeah, maybe it
holds an important place as the most affordable Mac, but if you're not buying one, you're not really thinking
about it too much. But the number one most insane
thing about this refresh is, well, I mean look at it, it's tiny. It is absolutely tiny. Apple's gone through and redesigned basically all of their computers now that have gotten the Mac silicon update. Well, except this one, this is the same design as a while ago, but the Mac mini was kind of technically overdue for a redesign. And the new one, it actually
kinda looks a little bit more like a shrunken Mac Studio
than a shrunken old Mac mini. But it's now a five inch
by five inch footprint and two inches tall. I'll say that again, a five by
five by two desktop computer. Now I like small desktops, and yes, you could get a
tiny desktop computer before, there's plenty of amazing
mini ITX build videos all over the internet that
I've watched for years. They're sick. But there's levels to this, there's small computers and
then there's tiny computers. And this Mac mini is smaller
than my R5 with a lens on it. It's smaller than a new roll of duct tape. It's smaller than the
footprint of the new iPhone and barely bigger than the
absolutely tiny Apple TV. Apple's seemingly had this obsession with making certain computers
as small as possible, even before Apple silicon came along. So this has just kind of
unlocked another level for them to push it even further than ever before. Yeah, there are fans in here, but there are also ports on the back. Gigabit ethernet by default,
full size HDMI is still here. And then three Thunderbolt
ports on the back and then there's two
USB-C 3 ports on the front plus the headphone jack. So still no SD card reader. And there's obviously now no more USB-A. If you tried to build or buy another computer
to match this thing, you will either end up building a computer that's just as small but
nowhere near as capable, or a computer that's just as capable, but nowhere near as small. It is just a hilariously
unnecessarily tiny computer. It's great. I would also like to start
a new conspiracy theory. I would like to use this video
to start a conspiracy theory. I think that there is someone
whose job it is at Apple, someone whose sole purpose
(sinister mysterious music) is to come up with one obnoxious
thing to complain about for every new Apple product redesign. Like this is the person that
put the notch on the iPhone. This is the person that
put the charge port at the bottom of the Magic Mouse. And this person's best work is right here on this new Mac mini, putting the power button
on the bottom of it. Like, why? There are so many better
places to put a power button, like at the front or the side, or literally anywhere on the back, like all the other small Mac desktops. Or at the top. That
would've been fine too. But no, they chose behind the back corner, which is (sighs) just... I mean, I don't use
that button very often. I don't really turn the Mac on and off with a button almost ever. I might sleep it and wake it back up, and maybe every couple of weeks, I'll have to remember that
the button's back there. But yeah, it's just dumb
enough to get memed on and complained about without
actually being an issue. Well played, guy. But yeah, you know, the
typical consequences of a computer getting smaller are battery, speakers, and thermals. There's just less room
inside for those things. Battery of course doesn't make a huge difference on a desktop, who cares? Speakers, kind of the
same thing, who cares? And thermals have been redesigned in a way that seem to be working just fine. This thing hardly gets over a peep. If you do heavy stuff,
the single fan spins up and you can hear it, but
it's always been quiet, sitting on the desk,
you can hardly hear it. So then the number two insane
thing about the new Mac mini is that the base model is kind
of an incredible deal now. No, like I don't think you understand it. I think it's actually one
of the best deals in tech. It's certainly the best out of any of Apple's new product
offerings right now. And I mean, I'm kind of
not used to saying it, but it is a really good deal. So this base M4 Mac mini costs 599, right? So for that, you get the base
computer with the M4 chip, which has quietly doubled
to 16 gigs of unified memory instead of eight from before. So the 10 core CPU and the 10 core GPU. Now we're four generations
into Apple silicon and the gains are
actually kind of starting to stack up versus M1. We already know it was a huge difference from the Intel chips, but I
actually wanna get a little bit more into that in the MacBook Pro review because I've been using
an M1 Max MacBook Pro for three years since it came out. And the M4 Max is the first one that's actually tempted me to upgrade between generations of Apple silicon. It's really interesting. So get subscribed and
stay tuned for that video when it comes out. But the main thing you need to know is this base M4 chip is great, it's super solid and power efficient at everyday normal
activities like web browsing and music streaming and
multitasking like crazy. And it can handle what
I think I would call medium-grade activities very easily. Not heavy stuff like
graphically-intensive gaming or a heavy video editing, but pretty much anything short of that. This could be a coding
and developing machine, this could be a photo editing machine. Pixelmator runs like a dream. And fun fact, Apple just bought
Pixelmator, interestingly. But yeah, just having
a ton of Arc tabs open, stuff like that, like just
running around, multitasking, it runs like a dream, it's great. It's as good as you'd expect the world's fastest single
core performer to do. So yeah, Mac mini, you know,
four years, like I said, it has been the most affordable Mac, the sort of entry point for
anyone to get into Mac OS. But this year with the
doubling of the base memory, it just feels like a
particularly good deal. Think of it this way, the M4 iMac that also just got refreshed is basically the exact same computer, but just in an upright desktop with a non replaceable display. That starts at $1,299. So you can use that $700 difference to kind of get whatever screen you want. Now, you can obviously also
upgrade from the base Mac mini, but I don't think you
should, and I'll explain why. See, Apple is known for building what I've called a price ladder, and they're just trying to get you to climb as high as possible. They do this across all their products, but there's basically always
a really tempting upgrade sitting right above the base model. And then when you spend that money, you're kind of right underneath
another tempting upgrade, and then they kind of walk you up, trying to get you to spend
as much money as possible. It's really smart, they do it with iPhones and with iPads and with everything else. This base Mac mini, I'm
telling you is a good deal, but it only has 256 gigs of storage. And many people are fine with that and they can live with that, that's great. But if you know you're gonna
be working with a lot of media, a lot of video, then you start looking at
upgrades to the storage, and that's where you'll
find that walking it up to a terabyte costs 400 more dollars. Or if you plan to do
some wired networking, bumping it up to 10 gig ethernet costs 100 more dollars on top of that. for the price of just those upgrades, you could almost get an
entire nother MAC mini. It's crazy. Like basically, across the board, Apple's upgrade pricing is
pretty crazy with this computer, which is why I'm specifically saying the base model is such a good deal. And actually if you're lucky enough to have a .edu email address right now, the student discount drops it
down to 499, which is sick. But once you know you're
gonna be doing upgrades to the pre-purchase spec, which you have to know before buying it, 'cause you can't upgrade
it after the fact, all the memory, everything is built in, then it becomes more of a normal deal. I do wanna say this though. So the third and final crazy
thing about this Mac Mini is that the maxed out version has a case for the best portable workstation Mac. Now this doesn't apply to everybody. This is coming from me, someone who used to drag an
iMac Pro in a Pelican case through the airport to events because it was the fastest editing machine that I could reasonably travel with, and it actually made sense for me. So coming from that perspective, this new Mac mini is sick. So looking at the Mac Studios, those aren't upgraded to M4 yet, they've all got the M2 generation. And it's also not gonna be the Mac Pro, which is also still on the M2 generation and obviously not portable. The iMac is on M4, but there's no Pro chips, so
it's just the base M4 chip. So this Mac mini is the easiest way to pack an M4 Pro chip with you and just throw it in a
travel bag super easily. An equivalent spec'd
MacBook Pro with M4 Pro starts at $2,000, which is actually another
decently good deal as far as performance. But if you don't need a laptop
or if you just wanna plug and play into monitors wherever you go, 1399 gets you the M4 Pro Mac mini. And that upgrade also gets
you the back Thunderbolt ports being Thunderbolt 5
instead of Thunderbolt 4. So it can support three 6K
displays instead of two. So I've had and been
testing the M4 Pro here with 48 gigs of memory, and fun fact, if you run through
some synthetic benchmarks, this runs up the highest CPU
score of any desktop Mac ever. That includes the Mac Pro and the Mac Studios and all of them. This is by far the most
powerful single core we've ever seen by a lot. And then Multi-Core just barely tops Geekbench's all time Mac list, though as we know, CPU doesn't
really bump up all that much when you go from base
to Pro to Max to Ultra, it's way more GPU stuff. And so when you look at GPU benchmarks, the most powerful Mac
mini here with the M4 Pro, it was putting up M1 Max numbers, which again, shows how much
these generations over time have been improving and
stacking on top of each other. I've been editing videos
on an M1 Max laptop for three years now on the MacBook Pro. So this Mac mini feels like one of those impossibly small computers Apple's like always
kind of wanted to make, even before Apple silicon. Like you probably remember
some of their earlier attempts, like the ""Trashcan"" MAC Pro, no doubt, they wanted do something crazy. They wanted to put a
workstation-class computer on the desk cooled by a single fan. We saw how that went with
the Intel chip inside, or even some of those
razor thin i9 MacBook Pros that started having overheating issues. But now that Apple silicon
has gotten this good and this efficient over time, they're actually able to
make tiny, powerful computers like the Mac Studio and now like this little
Mac mini over here. Nobody was asking for the
Mac mini to be even smaller, except for those people
in the Spaceship Campus somewhere in California. Well played. Well played. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace.

the self-driving Robotaxi. I explored the insane looking Robovan and I talked to the Optimus robot and then I left feeling kind of confused. It was a weird event. So here are the three
main big reasons why. So first of all, the robo
cab, this was the main thing that we knew we were going
to see, this full unveiling of a fully self-driving Tesla. And we saw it and it looked like this, very, very much like a mini Cybertruck. Like you've got the
light bar on the front, the light bar on the back, the complete lack of rear visibility. Then, of course you can
see it's a two-door, two seater passenger car. People were wondering like what a full self-driving
robo cab or cyber taxi, whatever we're calling it
would actually look like whether it'd look dramatically different from a normal car like a
Model 3 or even a Waymo. And there are some things that
are significantly different about this thing they rolled out. I mean on the outside it's light gold. Every single one is this
like silvery gold color, although there was never any
mention of actual materials. Pretty small footprint,
you can see there's no exterior door handles, or
mirrors, or anything like that. And then, since they don't
need any steering wheel or pedals, they can sort of push the seating position way
back into this more like loungey seating position kind
of near the middle of the car there's a center armrest and there's a massive 21 inch
touchscreen in the center. And yes, the doors go up
as if Tesla hasn't learned from their lessons of the Model X, they're making another crazy set of doors which, honestly, is
definitely a hit visually. It's a striking feature of
this car alongside the wheels which, at first, just look
like these huge gold discs. But then, when you take a closer look, they're actually just normal 21 inch low rolling resistance continental tires. But they've painted half
of the sidewall gold to match the caps in the middle. So it makes it look like a
super thin low profile tire with a huge wheel, but
it's not, it's just paint. But either way, no idea how
much of this is gonna make it to any sort of final production. But after waiting in line for a bit, I got to ride in this
thing for a few minutes. So I got in, the screen told
me to buckle my seatbelt, and once I did, the door
automatically closed, pretty smart. Then I just selected the destination, which was on this screen along this route, which I assume was pre-mapped. And then it just started
rolling, just started going. Now, I've been in a
self-driving Tesla before, but this one is just a
little bit more nervy since there's people everywhere and there's no steering
wheel in front of me. But once you get over the eeriness of basically being trapped
in this driverless car with no manual override,
I started looking around and noticing a few other things. You know, you sit pretty low to the road, similar to a Model 3,
but with more leg room since the seating position's further back. And then, there's even
fewer physical controls than ever before in this car. Like I basically only found
that the window switches were in the middle next to the cup holders. I didn't even see any door latches. Like the doors only opened with a button on this enormous touch screen. So again, like a Tesla, it's
gonna control everything in the car on the screen
including just watching movies while the car is driving because why not? So you can watch the entire trip that I took uncut on
the auto-focus channel if you want, I'll link that below. But then the thing is
that's kind of all we got. Like there were shockingly
few details about the actual car actually
explained at this event other than basically like
the three main pillars which are gonna be in all the
headlines which are number one that it will be fully
unsupervised, self-driving capable. Number two, that it'll
be able to be purchased for under $30,000, all right. But then number three, that
it would actually also charge by inductive wireless charging. So it pulls up over this
wireless charging pad on the ground and it
would charge that way. Not something we've seen
shipping in very many cars, especially not ones with large
batteries, but that was it. No other numbers, no other specs. Just look at this thing,
there's just concepts of a plan. I just had so many other
questions after seeing that. Like what is going on here? I did at the event walk
around after the announcement and bump into some Tesla engineers and people who had been
working on these things. And so, I just ended up
kind of grilling them. Like I asked them a
whole bunch of questions. So I'm gonna tell you guys
what I learned from them and I guess we can take their word for it. So first of all, there
is no steering wheel or pedals, as you can see
so my first question was, all right, let's say I
see an accident coming or there's something happening
on the road in front of me and the car isn't reacting in time, is there a manual override? And the answer I got
was, sure, there will be some sort of minimal
onscreen controls available, but the goal is that you
never have to override which is a noble goal, for sure. I just mean it's hard to imagine. We live in a world
where that's impossible, basically, right now but I mean, even with the wireless charger, picture you wanna like drive over the top of it and line it up perfectly because if it's off a little bit, that's just a giant waste of power. But if I can't adjust it
like that would be terrible. But speaking of wireless charging, you might be wondering why
they would try to do this? The main answer, again,
is because they want it to be totally autonomous. They want people to just
be able to own several, like a fleet of these things
and they all just drive around and charge themselves overnight. And the whole cable
plugging in charging thing requires a human so that's
one less human required. It'll just line up on the notoriously inefficient wireless charger. But my question again was, okay, is there at least a charge port
so if I want to supercharge or charge quickly, I can do that? And the answer was, no, there is no charge port on this vehicle. So it is not even capable of
hitting a Tesla supercharger, or doing any sort of road trips, or anything like that, it's purely a taxi. I'm told there is no
plans for a front trunk. There's just the rear trunk that they showed in this presentation. And there's no planned range
or a stated battery size. But what they did say
is they're simply aiming for this vehicle to be
as efficient as possible, that's their main goal,
between the aerodynamics and the low rolling
resistance tires, they think they can aim for about 5.5
miles per kilowatt hour. Some of the most efficient
electric cars we see today are getting around 3 to 4
miles per kilowatt hour. So this would be like
an A plus efficiency, if they achieve this and
that's what will let them use a smaller overall size battery for the lighter weight of the vehicle. So it'll be nice, they're
saying, to clear 200 miles of total range and that would put this at maybe a 40 kilowatt hour battery pack instead of the typical 70 to 130. So drive train wise, that
logic does check out. You wanna make the cheapest,
most efficient electric car of all time, you gotta hit those things. But then again, you're
also telling us this while doing a car with scissor
doors and wireless charging. So you're gonna have some
challenges there, for sure. But really I think the obvious red flag, the biggest red flag to me
is the timeline stuff that, I mean this is notorious Elon stuff. He gets on stage, he
says, ""We're gonna have ""this vehicle out for
$30,000 before 2027."" No they're not, there's just no way that they're actually
gonna be able to do that. I mean if they do, let's say they do, I will shave my head on camera 'cause I'm not confident they won't do it. Like I wanna be optimistic,
but there's just too much stacked up against it because in order to ship this at all with no steering wheel and everything, they have to get all
the regulatory approval for the full self-driving and all that, and get all the prices
down in spite of inflation and ship something with scissor
doors and all this stuff in the next two years,
there's just no way. Tesla's been promising full
unsupervised self-driving for years over and over and over again and consistently keeps pushing it back. But then also just
price-wise, I get the goal, but Tesla promised a $35,000
Model 3 and years later I think they briefly
actually shipped that car for that price for a little
bit before discontinuing it. Cybertruck, I don't know if you remember, do you remember the base price of what they said the Cybertruck would cost at the cheapest version when it came out? $39,000 and that was about what, like four or five years ago? Do you know what the cheapest
Cybertruck is right now? $95,000, so you can see where
my skepticism is coming from. But even after all that, you know, there's kind of a
philosophical question too which is what is the
difference between this, this Robotaxi thing and a Model 3? Because Tesla has been promising for years that the car that people are driving and buying today is gonna be capable of full unsupervised self-driving, like the Model 3 and the Model Y? And it's actually not clear if there's that many differences. I mean, obviously, okay, one's
gonna have a steering wheel and four doors and four
seats and the whole thing and maybe be a bit more expensive. But like, yeah, if my car is gonna be able to do all that stuff I think I want the one that can plug into superchargers and do all sorts of carrying things. Maybe this will be an old fashioned way of thinking at some time in the future, like every car on the road is autonomous and it's like an ""old
school"" thing to want the one with the steering wheel that
you can drive sometimes, maybe. I think the main
advantage of the Robotaxi, if it has the exact same capabilities as a Model 3 is it'll
be cheaper, and smaller and easier to operate
in a fleet situation. That will probably be the main difference as far as actually buying these things because they've been
selling people the dream of the car that you buy and own today, you'll drive it to work and
then, when you're at work, it'll go drive people around as an Uber for 10 hours or however long and then, you drive it home when you need it and then, when you're
sleeping it'll continue to drive and Uber people around. And so, it has all these
amazing capabilities, it'll do all this great
stuff, but will it though? There's actually a moment I had to re-watch the event 'cause I was there and people are like
yelling out the whole time like stuff at Elon on stage. And at this point in the
presentation he goes like, oh yeah, Model 3 and Model Y
will also do full self-driving. And then someone goes like,
what about the Cybertruck? And then he says, oh yeah,
don't worry, Cybertruck too. - So and Cybertruck too, yes, of course. Sorry, I don't wanna forget, yes, yes. All our cars, basically. - So yeah, okay, all our vehicles great, but then it's kind of quiet, but then someone else yells
out, ""What about Hardware 3?"" Which is, basically if you don't know, a reference to older Model 3s. And his response... - So... [Audience Member] Hardware
3, Hardware 3, Hardware 3. - Let's not get nuanced here. - [Audience Member] What?
- All right, next slide. - So yeah, let's not get
too nuanced, all our cars will have it except maybe
some of the old ones. All our cars will be able to
self-drive though, totally. We'll cross that bridge when
we get to it, how 'bout that? But here's a bridge that I don't think we'll ever actually get to cross, which is the second thing that was insane that was announced at this
event, which is the Robovan. So somewhere about halfway
through this presentation, they roll out this one of one super futuristic looking
massive van thing. Kind of looked like a... It looked like the military vehicles from
""I, Robot,"" to be honest, which that's probably not a good thing. But yeah, it rolls out and they give us, again, very, very few details. This is gonna be a Robovan that can hold like up to 20-ish people and it, again, will be fully electric
and fully autonomous and take groups or teams of
people from point A to point B. No manual override necessary, great. Have you ever been to CES? Have you ever watched videos from CES? Every year in January
there's this trade show, it's really fun, in
Vegas and if you ever go, you'll notice in the south hall there's a section with all the
cars, the mobility section. And you'll find about 50 of these, every year there's just like
a van with no steering wheel and a bunch of seats
that all face the middle. And it's like the future
of mobility concept. There's tons of those. None of them ever ship, of
course, because there are rules. But I guess there's
not, to me, a whole lot that differentiates that brief concept we saw at the Tesla event with dozens of other vaporware versions of this that I've seen before,
that's all I'm saying. I mean, the fact that
this one comes from Tesla is the main differentiator,
this is the company that could maybe
theoretically make it happen. But like I said, there's almost
no details about this thing. And I have almost no faith that
that thing that they showed with its minimal clearance,
and its glass everywhere and just lack of numbers or anything I don't think that we'll
ever actually see that thing. I could eat my words, but
like that seems crazy. But then last but not least,
Tesla decided to bring back... They decided to remind
us that they're also an AI company, not just a car company by bringing back out the
Optimus humanoid robot again. So they had these things all
over this event this time, dancing, doing these pre-rehearsed demos. But also, they were just
kind of out and about. They were serving drinks and snacks and they were walking
around and interacting with and entertaining people
just like hanging out amongst everyone at this event. Now, I already have my thoughts
that I've talked about, you know, humanoid robots before. I made a whole video about
it, if you wanna watch it, I'll leave a link below the Like button. I've talked about Tesla's Optimus. But even just what we saw with that, would've been a huge step forward
from what we've ever seen. Like this would've been one of the most impressive things ever. But then, they decided to take it further. They also decided to have
these robots talking to people and, I mean, it was way
too fast to be an LLM. Like just watch this clip. - [Optimus] Would you
like a piece of chocolate? - I will take some chocolate. - [Optimus] Right on, what's your name? - [Vanessa] Vanessa. - [Optimus] Vanessa? - Yes, Vanessa. - [Optimus] Nice, pleasure
to meet you, Vanessa. - Nice to meet you too.
- [Optimus] I'm Optimus. - [Optimus] Have a great night
- [Vanessa] Great Optimus thank you.
- [Optimus] Bye. - Like it's just a person, it's a person talking through a speaker. It it even like stutters and makes occasional like human mistakes. If you watch a bunch of
videos from the event, a bunch of different robots all have slightly different voices. Yeah, it was a person, for sure. And it's weird because Tesla, at no point, at least as of the time of recording, has not acknowledged this at all. They haven't said that or confirmed that, but people there at the event
have heard various things from various engineers,
I talked to two engineers who only would tell me,
yes, all of the LLMs do run totally on device. But like, yeah, no, I don't think so. So this kind of became
like the talking point of the whole event, like now we don't know how much of this event
was real or not so real. Like how much of what
these robots are doing is human controlled or AI. You know, there were all
kinds of hand waving, and gestures and movements. I played charades with one of them. You know what it reminds me of? Remember that video I did at
Disney's Imagineering Labs where they had these bipedal robots that were controlled by
a steam deck controller? They did all kinds of walking around and stringing animations together to entertain people at the parks. There's just a bunch of button presses and controllers to make that happen. And sure, there's some
AI to blend that stuff, but you could never deny that there's, basically, entirely human
control happening here. And that's, basically,
what I think is happening at this Tesla event, lots of impressive and entertaining things in the form of a super advanced articulating robot stringing animations together. But it's just not totally ready
to do this stuff on its own. We've never seen anything quite like it, even from Boston Dynamics,
but we gotta be real about the human assisted part. But the thing is, the dream that they are selling people
with this specific robot is that this thing will
live with you basically, it will be your human
sized friend, actually. They said that it would be your friend, it would do chores for you,
it would live around you and be able to do all these
sorts of tasks on its own using the AI and the vision-based system. I think that's a really far off dream. AI is really, really quickly improving. But I still think that's a far off dream. So, you know, to their credit,
this event, it was insane. Like they did a lot of things
that could have gone wrong. And if you told me in 2024 that a company would do a bunch of self-driving car demos around tons of people
just loose in the road and they would have bipedal
humanoid robots roaming around performing tasks
and entertaining people at the same event and that they would have a drone show like that
is just a lot of stuff in a row that is super high tech that could go wrong, but somehow didn't. And it represented, I think,
a very optimistic view of the future, even though
it's very much still like concepts, it's a future that is potentially way more efficient,
potentially way safer and more impressive in
general technologically than the world we live in today. So that by itself, I think is honorable. The things that they
were hoping to be real would be amazing and inspirational and honorable if they actually happened. But since they are also
a public tech company, they felt the need to do demos and give all these big promises. And that's where it felt
weird because it's really hard to make promises about when
we're gonna deliver this future and for what price we're
gonna deliver this future when it just feels very unlikely. And then doing the like, robots talking, it's just like now the
whole thing is in question. Like how much of it is real,
how much of it is fake? And then, now we're focusing on that instead of how cool the future
could someday actually be. That's where I'm at but
hey, if there is one company that has the best chance of
bringing this all to life, if you made me bet money on one company that I think has the best
odds to get there eventually, then, yeah, it would be the one with the massive data gathering advantage with stuff out there in
the real world today. It would be Tesla so I'll
believe it when I see it. Thanks for watching, catch you
guys in the next one, peace.","14:30 you're a tech guy and don't know about voice AI generators, yes it can produce human like voices even stutter | This video will age VERY poorly lol | The car will perfectly drive on top of the charger - not a human | you might have to as I believe they are doing it in CA and TX this year in summer | 7:49  marques shaves head Infront of camera noted. | It may be possible tesla in dallas are hiring drivers right now just to drive teslas for 5 to 8 hours a day to get all the information of how humans drive. | 😮😮😮 | I like this guy, he gives me rational fears | Looks like you're going to have to shave your head 😂 | I love Tesla but those wheels are big and dumb.

kkX8_nbBqBQ,Android 15 Hands-On: Top 5 Features!,Android 15 features are more subtle and hidden than ever. These are the best ones MKBHD Merch: http://shop.MKBHD.com Tech ...,2024-05-28T21:40:15Z,3547200,129350,7230,"(light music) - Hey, what's up, MKBHD here
and I've got the latest beta of Android 15 on my
Pixel 8 Pro right here. So a lot of you know, I've done these videos for a long time. Like I've made a video
on the best features of the latest version of Android for I don't know how
many years in a row now, since they were naming 'em after desserts. And if you've been watching all of these, then you've noticed a trend, which is there used to
be huge new features and massive like visual
overhauls and all sorts of crazy gigantic things
changing with Android. But now things have
stabilized, I would say. It's a lot more small changes and more nuanced things here and there. So it's gotten to the point
where these top five features of Android 15, back in the day, this would've been like a .0.2 update. Like, these are smaller and smaller new features with each new version. But on the other hand, that
actually feels like it is... They're a little more well considered. They're more about usefulness, they're more about little tweaks here and there to make actually using and owning your phone a little bit better. So I can appreciate that. And I will also say it, it's felt like in videos in the past, I've said that, you know, this is a version
that's only gonna show up on the Pixel for at least a year and you may never get to see
the newest version of Android, but I feel like with a lot
of the newest companies actually promising a good amount of software updates into the future, hopefully more people will actually see these couple of things. So I'm just gonna jump right in. These are the top five best features I've found in Android 15. So number five is called
Private Space and it's, yeah, it's exactly what it sounds like. It's a private space on your Android phone for your top secret files and photos and whatever else you got in there. So to turn it on, you go to Settings and then Security & Privacy and then Private Space is near the bottom. So you confirm it's you and
you pick a Google account and a new lock if you want. Then this Private Space is set up and basically you can
always find it all the way at the bottom of your app drawer, like that's where it lives. So obviously, if you were to
like give someone your phone to borrow for a while, you
could put it in Guest Mode and it would just basically be a brand new phone for them set up. But yeah, Private Space is different. It's more of just a separate section under a separate lock underneath the phone that you're already logged
into and signed up for. So it's basically a
whole new little section of your phone hidden
away behind a second lock for your top secret activities, apps, files, photos, whatever you want. And when you wanna hide it
away again, you just hit Lock. You could put whatever you want
in there, totally up to you. Then number four, so I'm kind of combining a lot of these things. I've done this in videos in the past. It's just a whole bunch
of the little things that sort of stack up to feel like a more refined experience. So number four is the little things. Like, one of them is rich widget previews, which obviously is not a huge thing 'cause how often are you actually adding new widgets to your home screen? Not very much. But when you do now, the widgets that support this will
actually show you content that will actually be on
them before they get added and they're in live and real time and represent real things on your phone. This could have maybe
been higher on my list, but at this point it's so new that it's basically only
like two of Google's apps. Like, it's just the clocks
and widgets around that. But it would be nice
to see more Google apps and even more third party apps adopt this. Like, I want to see, in the
example widget before I add it, like one of my actual notion
boards instead of a made-up one or one of my actual contacts
instead of a random person. Another one is this new back animation when you move backwards
through like settings or anything with multiple
layers that you can back out of. I think it's a little bit
smoother, a little nicer. Another one is Bluetooth audio sharing. You can have multiple headphones paired to the same Bluetooth audio source as long as they support Bluetooth LE, which most new headphones do. Another one is High Quality Mode when you use your Android
phone as your webcam. Another one is Bluetooth Auto On. So if you turn Bluetooth
off on your phone, then the next day it automatically
gets turned back on again so you don't have to remember to. And there's just a whole bunch
more little things like that. It feels like every year
Google pays attention to the little things about
the way we use our phones and then can add stuff to help us there. But speaking of little things, I'm making number three by itself one of those little things, which
is the new volume sliders. So right now when I hit Volume, it looks the way it normally does, the Auto Live Caption button
is still there on the Pixel, totally underrated feature, and then your mode switcher at the top. But then when you hit
the three dots to expand, you get this whole almost
full screen overlay showing where you're playing audio to and then all of the sliders for volume of everything happening on your phone. And this is something, you
know, that's been smaller and in various other forms and
previous versions of Android, but I like this big one. Just makes it super clear what's going on and how loud each individual
thing is going to be. So then now we're getting to the top. Number two is partial screen recordings. So I think normally when you do a screen recording on your phone, you just expect to see everything, right? You just start it, it's your home screen, it's every single app you switch between, everything happening on your phone. That's a normal screen recording. But I've been playing with
screen recordings here on the Pixel with this dev preview and it's a lot smarter about only showing if you want individual single things happening on your phone. So when you go to initiate
a screen recording, you can either do the entire screen, which is normal, or a single app. So check this out, if I do single app and then start recording,
it gives me a picker to choose which app I want to record. I'll pick one of the
ones I already have open, Relay Reddit, just for this example. The countdown starts at the top and then it's recording this Reddit app. So I can scroll around,
just use it as usual, but now watch, if I go home and then open another app like Photos and then scroll around in here, and then go back home,
go back to the Relay app, then scroll some more,
that's the screen recording. Now check this out, when you go to watch the screen
recording, it looks normal, but then the moment I go
home and then go to Photos, see, that doesn't show up
in the screen recording. It's still just recording the Reddit app even though it's in the background now. And then you can see when I get back to it and starts scrolling some more, it picks up where it left off. So it's only specifically
showing what I want you to see. And this is super useful. I think this is my new
default for screen recordings. You don't have to see, you know, a random text message I have coming in or me copying and pasting a security code from another app or anything like that. It's just me giving you a tutorial on like one exact thing
that I wanna show you. That's pretty cool. But then number one, this
is one of those things that Android has been really good at and had the edge at for years, which is just better notifications and notification management. And so far with these two previews, it's even better in
specifically a couple of ways. There's Adaptive Vibrations, there is Notification Cool Down,
there is custom vibrations, there's a whole bunch of stuff,
so I'll walk through each. So Adaptive Vibration is fascinating. It kind of just seems like another one of those magic-feeling Google things, but you go into Vibration
Settings and just turn it on, there's no further settings. But it basically says it's
using your phone's mic and other sensors to determine
the sound levels around it and potentially even what
type of surface it's on to set the strength of vibration so you can always feel or hear it. So the idea is if your phone
is on like a desk somewhere or a hard surface, it doesn't have to rattle the thing at maximum strength to be heard, it can turn it down. But then if it's on a
couch or something softer, it will pick that up and
it will vibrate more loudly or more firmly so you can
actually still hear it, clever. And then there's another thing
in Dev Preview 1 at least that was called Notification Cool Down, which is literally just a setting to be able to help you manage when you get a ton of notifications from the same app over and over in a row. 'Cause we've all been in that
group chat that's going nuts or the Slack channel that won't shut up, or Asana or whatever, something that's just
constantly pinging you over and over with the same app. And so Notification Cool
Down, when you enable that, will just sort of taper that
off and keep you updated on when a bunch of new
stuff comes in, but not just buzz you over and over.
(fingers tapping) Now that was in Dev Preview 1 and then this is Dev Preview 2 and it's not in this one, it's gone. I'm not sure why, but I
hope they bring that back. I hope they keep it
'cause that's pretty sick. And then there's even
more subtle one that's, 'cause it's basically hidden to users, this is something developers have seen, which is individual
vibration patterns per app. 'Cause see, some of you
aren't old enough to remember when smartphones had LED
notification lights on them, multicolor lights that would actually have a different color light up based on what app you were getting
a notification from. So I could know, without
waking up my phone, if I had a blinking blue light happening, oh, that's a Twitter
notification, I can ignore it. Or if it was a blinking green light, then it's a new Gmail
notification and I can ignore it. But if it's a new blinking red light, then it's a new missed
call and I can ignore it. But then phones all got
rid of these lights. So now we wake up our phones every time I wanna check on something. And if you have it always on
display, that can be useful. But in a surface shown to developers, they have the ability now to customize their own vibration pattern
specific to their app. So I think that's pretty sick. I'm kinda hoping, and this
is totally just hoping, but I hope that they surface
that to users as well. I hope, just like I've been able to pick between a bunch of
different weather icon apps for my one app that does weather, I hope they let me choose between a couple custom vibration sounds or vibration patterns for apps because I would love to customize and feel that I've gotten
a Twitter notification and that I can still ignore it. Now for those wondering,
since we check every year, when you go into Settings, it doesn't actually say Android 15, it says Vanilla Ice Cream
for this Dev Preview 2. And when you click into it,
this is the animated Easter egg, which looks nothing
like vanilla ice cream, but for what it's worth, it's
a little more space-like. But now here's the thing, if
you hold it down long enough, it speeds up all the way and then snaps and turns into this, this
sort of random spacecraft in the middle of what seems
like a nearly infinite canvas. Kinda reminds me of that asteroids game from back in the day. But you don't shoot anything, you just kinda fly around
using this thrust vector and explore this gigantic space. The only thing that worries
me is that in the corner, it says BODIES: 0 / 10. So I think if people explore
this thing long enough, they're gonna find bodies,
whatever that means. But yeah, like I said, a
bunch of subtle things, some new notification
stuff here and there, some new management usage
of your phone type stuff. It's nuanced, it's subtle. I'm still excited for some of

stuff that we're expecting to make a big difference
the way we use our phones. It's just not built into Android anymore. It's the AI stuff that
your phone is capable of that's not in the OS.

HN-WH7C4K0Q,Here&#39;s the Thing about the M3 Macbook Air...,"Usually it's the easiest laptop in the world recommend. This time, there's a wrinkle... Get a dbrand leather skin at ...",2024-03-20T21:20:58Z,5611020,123140,6175,"(Intro music) - That's crazy that the
most interesting things about this new laptop are
the reasons not to buy it. So the MacBook Air just got refreshed. It's a pretty simple update,
maybe a boring one actually. There's really only two things new. It has this new
anodization on the outside, apparently a slightly more
fingerprint resistant look to it. And it has the new M3 chip inside. So the coating, I don't know, it barely makes a difference
if I'm being honest. It still gets fingerprints
if you handle it regularly without a skin or a case. I would much rather depend
on something like a skin from channel sponsor Dbrand. It lets you break out
from one of the three really simple colors and
it's gonna hide fingerprints a million times better than
any metal treatment ever could. Plus these are real leather, so they have a nice plush texture and it'll patina over time. So I'll leave a link to this one below. But the other new thing
is this M3 chip inside. So we've seen this M3 chip
before, this is what Apple does. They put the same chip everywhere. This came out in October of last year and they immediately
put it in the new iMac. And then we also got a new
MacBook Pro that launched with this and the M3 PRO and the M3 Max. So okay, new M3 Apple silicon,
third generation, great. So now we're finally getting
this new base M3 chip in the new MacBook Air, side
note, why does it take so long? I don't know, it feels like
Apple kind of staggers it probably on purpose, but like
it's the same chip everywhere. They've done the iMac,
they've done the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, but the
Mac Mini just staying on M2, kind of weird. Also the new iPad Pro still on M2. When's that gonna get it? Anyway, you already know
that the MacBook Air is the most popular Mac for a reason. This is the base like entry level Mac that most people are seeing as the way to get into the Mac world. And so the base MacBook
Air has typically been one of the easiest to recommend
laptops in the world by design. But this one, interestingly,
for two reasons, isn't. Now, this has nothing to
do with performance of M3 or anything weird like that. Like it's the performance
you were expecting. If you look at benchmarks,
it's right around that 10 to 20% improvement over M2 depending on what you're doing. Definitely leans heavier on graphics improvements this generation. And there's the rate tracing now finally. So any applications or rendering that are
taken advantage of that, that's gonna be a noticeable
improvement for M3. And it's clearly a more capable chip. And also MacBook Airs,
especially the 15 inch, just constantly get great
battery life across the board. You also get now dual
external display support with the lid closed, but one external display
with the laptop open. And it also appears that the base storage
on M3 is much improved. So this was one of those concerns from, if you look back at M2, you know obviously Apple seeds reviewers with higher end MacBooks, so
most of us aren't getting that. But if you look back at M2 the base 256 gig model used
a single SSD module instead of two SSDs. Long story short, that
storage module was way slower than M1, like 50% slower on paper. Would you have noticed if nobody told you and had never benchmarked it? Maybe, possibly not, but obviously it's a bummer
having way slower storage on a new M2 and that extra
time transferring large files, that adds up over time. So I'm happy to report that
I've seen really good benchmarks on the base storage of the M3 Air. It appears that they fixed it, awesome. So what's the deal with this M3 Air then? Why am I saying it's not necessarily the best recommendation? Well, historically, MacBook
Air has been super easy to recommend, but with this M3, they also lowered the price
of M2 by a hundred bucks and discontinued the M1. So now the lineup is M3
MacBook Air starts at 1099, then M2 MacBook Air starts at 999 and then M1, it's kind of gone from Apple, but you can still find stock that's left at like Walmart or Best Buy. Now the thing about the
MacBook Air being easy to recommend is we're
talking about regular people, which it's very light, regular, normal usage like web browsing,
listening to music, a bunch of tabs open, work stuff,
occasionally compiling or rendering some small
things, photo editing and chopping a video or two sometimes, but really very light. So these people, like type of people who would buy a laptop at
Walmart would be totally fine with the cheaper identical
looking MacBook Air with the slightly slower
M2 chip and slower storage. I think they would be totally fine. But the other thing which
I need to talk about is this whole base spec thing. This is not exactly new to the
industry, but the base price and the base spec has almost
become like this weird fallacy. Like I think it was Linus who did a video about how starting at is
like the biggest lie in tech. And he's right, it's not just tech, like the car industry
does it all the time too. Starting at, you know,
this super low price, but nobody actually gets it at that price. You're not gonna get a
totally bare base model car. The base price is really
more to give you an idea of how much you're about to spend when you actually option
it up the way you want to. And the issue with these
is Apple's markup prices for above base spec is crazy high. Like Apple charges way too much
for the most basic upgrades. Obviously Apple Silicon
computers are all a system on a chip, so they cannot be upgraded ever after you buy them, right? So once you buy it, you know, you're kind of incentivized if you're
gonna keep it for a long time to splurge a little bit and give yourself some extra
headroom and future proof it and bump up that spec. But Apple charges so much
for bumping up that spec that the base price feels
like kind of even more of a lie than usual. So the MacBook Air starts in 2024, again, at eight gigs of shared
RAM and 256 gigs of storage. Now, ignoring the fact that
the phone I'm using also has more than eight gigs of RAM and 256 gigs of storage, if
you want to upgrade to 16 gigs of memory, the first available
RAM upgrade, that's $200. And if you wanna bump up
to just the half a terabyte of storage, that's
another 200 more dollars. Compared to to how much
that actually costs Apple, especially at the scale
that they're operating, that is just crazy,
brutal, ridiculous pricing. So even if you do just that, suddenly the MacBook Air M3 is $1,500. So either you're cool with
knowing you're actually buying a 1500 plus dollars MacBook
Air or the real question is, is the base spec in 2024 actually usable? And my take is actually
sometimes yes, sometimes yes. So again, if you're the
people I talked about earlier, you're you're buying a laptop
from the showcase at Walmart or Best Buy, you just need
it to do the basic stuff I mentioned earlier, you actually can do that with eight gigs of shared memory, no problem. This might seem like a hot take, but I've spent a lot of
time doing this stuff. You rarely actually get
close to hitting the max and hitting memory swap. And even when you do,
it's very much still fine. It's when you get into the
heavier stuff like media encoding or exporting or gaming that
it's a whole nother story. So if you're watching this video, you already know which
group of people you're in. So for that massive group of
people who are doing a lot of that normal, baseline computing stuff, don't buy the new M3 MacBook Air. You can very easily get an M2 MacBook Air and save your money. Matter of fact, if you don't
need the brighter display, the MagSafe, the external display support, which you probably don't at this rate, it's also a great idea
to look into Best Buy or Walmart's like six,
$700 M1 MacBook Airs that they're selling right now. I think Walmart first announced
they would have it for 699 and then a few days
later Best Buy announced that they'd sell it for
649, which is pretty sick. So clearly M3 is a much
more capable overall chip and brings the floor of a laptop up. But the way I see it, what
Apple silicon has done to Apple's lineup is it's
brought down the minimum level of machine that you can get
away with doing your workflow. Does that make sense? So like me, I edit a lot of videos and so I need a powerful
machine for Final Cut Pro and that sort of stuff, right? So for the longest time I could
only use an Apple Desktop, the highest end iMac Pro, the
Mac Pro, and I still will, but I am now able to use Mac
Studio and I can actually edit. I've had an M1 Max MacBook Pro for a while and I've been editing
on the go with a laptop, which is a huge like enabler for me. And the same sort of thing
applies if you're doing like gaming stuff or if you have
a whole bunch of coding and heavy, maybe even just encoding photos or whatever you're doing at that level, you'd typically rely on a MacBook Pro. But with these new chips
and with Apple silicon, you can do that on a high-end
MacBook Air, which is again, a pretty sweet enabler. So that's what the new M3 MacBook Air is. If you do that sort of stuff,
it's an amazing computer. It should be on your shortlist. Great all around, easy to recommend. But again, if you're doing
the lightweight, normal stuff and you need a MacBook
Air, don't get this one. Get the cheaper one. Okay, that's it. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys the next one, peace. ♪ It's the money, it's it's

VdOlqcg9uMQ,Nothing Phone 2A Review: Flashy Good Deal!,Nothing Phone 2a is an impressive and smooth phone for $350! Get a dbrand something skin at ...,2024-03-05T12:28:28Z,3186013,99292,4236,"(cube bounces) (electronic crackling) - Budget phones are fun, because, pretty much with all of them, if you poke around hard enough, you will find the thing that
they had to cut corners on, you'll find the thing
that they trimmed back to get it to be a budget phone. And so for picking one for
you, it's just a matter of picking the one that
makes the trade offs that you're okay with. Like maybe you love, you gotta have good build
quality and cameras. Well then, iPhone SE is
probably a good one for you. And then you know you're
not gonna get a great screen or battery life or things like that. Or maybe you gotta have
a great big screen. Samsung makes the Galaxy A54. Ar maybe you gotta have
good software and cameras. Pixel 7A. This phone is 350 bucks. And this, this is the designer one. (sophisticated electro-jazz music) (electronic crackling) So, this phone is not
going to win anyone over with raw specs. It's not gonna win by
having the best camera or the best battery life
of any budget phone. The performance isn't gonna
blow you outta the water, but you could definitely argue that it's the prettiest $350 phone. So Nothing has had this
transparent aesthetic going for a while with their phones, and then also the earbuds. This one definitely also has that. There's also a white version of this. I think it looks better, it
also has like black buttons, so it's kinda this nice contrast, but, you know, dark
version looks cool too. And honestly if the mission is
to look like a Nothing phone, and not be mistaken for anything else, then, yeah, mission
definitely accomplished. The dual cameras in the
middle and near the top is pretty unique. Kinda like a pair of eyes maybe. And the NFC coil actually
surrounds the cameras. Then there are three bars of
LEDs making a glyph design around the camera circle again. Then it's kinda this split design, the bottom half is like
a PCB-inspired look, apparently inspired by the
New York City subway map. And Nothing's already shown people this, like there's been some
reactions to the design already. Some people love it, some
people actually hate it. I don't know, it's a bit asymmetrical, so it's unconventional for
sure, but I think it's nice, not gonna lie. But even if you don't like
it, at least you can say it's at least somewhat
visually interesting. You know, there's some textures,
there's some exposed screws and some text and that little red square, it's not functional, it's
just purely to look cool, so, I appreciate that. And if you do like this look but have maybe a more boring phone that you're not willing to give up, then channel sponsor dbrand has you covered with
their Something skins. So if you haven't heard of it already, dbrand has performed some, and these are their words, not mine, ""Creative plagiarism"" on
Nothing's whole design language, both in light mode and dark mode, so I'll leave a link below
if you wanna check those out. But guess what? It's an extremely
competitive price bracket, so you get a good looking phone, but you still will have to
make some sacrifices to get it. So first of all, it's clear
plastic, not glass, at the back. Which, you know, I'm sure Zach will get to
this phone at some point, but I think it'll be easier
to scuff and scratch, but harder to shatter,
like glass would be, so, but I think it's a
reasonable trade off. It's also a textured
plastic frame as well, so it looks like aluminum, but it's this plastic all
the way around the phone, to the point where this phone
actually ends up feeling surprisingly light in the
hand for how big it is. But we should just get to that, this is a huge, it's a
jumbo-sized phone, it's gigantic. Some people might not love that, but I think a lotta people
like really big screens, and you get the natural advantages that come with a big phone, which is a big battery and a big screen. So this is a relatively
giant 6.7-inch display corner to corner. It's literally ultra phone size. And it gets pretty bright too, so definitely not flagship bright, 'cause we have some
crazy numbers these days, but 1300 knits peak brightness is very visible in bright indoor lighting, and bezels are even all the way around the front of the phone, so, aesthetically, I have no complaints. And then even at this price, it's AMOLED, it has an optical fingerprint
reader under the glass. Its variable refresh rate up to 120 hertz. And it even has 2160 hertz PWM dimming. So if you don't like
the back of this phone, at least the front of it, that you're actually
looking at all the time, is pretty impressive for 350 bucks. But I'd say an even bigger
strength to this phone is battery life. So battery always comes from
three main things, basically, obviously having a huge physical battery. Also good software and an efficient chip. We'll get to the software. But, this phone has a
5000-milliamp hour battery, that's literally bigger than their flagship phones from Nothing, so, really big battery. It doesn't have wireless charging, but it does have 45-watt wire charging. Which is pretty good, that's
zero to full in an hour. And the chip it's running
is this little thing called the MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro. So, this was my biggest
question mark, actually, going into testing this phone, 'cause, you know how Nothing teases the specs and stuff ahead of time. So we find out it's a MediaTek chip, and I'm not sure if this
one's going to perform the way I've been used
to some other phones, like they're showcasing
all these, you know, specifically handpicked
benchmarks results, of course they will, but
conveniently, they only compare it to a two-year-old Nothing Phone 1 which had that mid-range,
778G Plus from Qualcomm. Now, I'm not expecting
flagship stuff for 350 bucks, but like, what's it gonna land at, this feels like a make or
break part of the phone. And I've been pleasantly surprised. Now, it's not gonna win
any prizes with raw specs, and I definitely don't think
it'll earn anybody's money with the benchmark scores alone, you look at those numbers, you're like ""Okay, not
a total shock here."" But as far as actual performance,
when you use the phone, the way I'd put it is, it's respectable, and I really feel like that is
a testament to the software, and how well it's working together. So, at this point we're on Nothing OS 2.5, on top of Android 14. And you already have seen
Nothing Phone software with the dots and the
aesthetic and all that stuff, but, it's clean, there's no bloat wear, and there is a solid
focus on fast and smooth, it kinda feels like a throwback to the old OnePlus Magic back in the day. But with regular use, this phone
is quite smooth and snappy. Sometimes a fingerprint
reader shudders a little bit, like when you're first unlocking, but for the most part, if you're just using the phone
doing stuff like messaging or flipping through a couple
apps, email, web browsing, taking your pictures,
this is a smooth phone. It's pretty similar to what they did with the Nothing Phone 1, with this 778. It's very solid with everyday use, and the second you try to
do super high-end stuff, like gaming, then you'll see where the
benchmarks come up short, where you start dropping
frames and all that. But, again, this is a $350 phone and I am definitely not
complaining about that. Now Nothing has had some time now to build up their aesthetic
and their identity and what they really want
a Nothing phone to be. And I gotta say, they
have a lot of unique, really identifiable things going on here that you may like or dislike,
but they're all here. So aesthetically they've
got the dots everywhere. So the stock apps have
this dots aesthetic, and the thin font to go with it. The back arrow in Android
is made of these dots. And they have this extensive
built-out selection of Nothing widgets now, most of them with the dots theme as well, so you can have this very
consistent home screen aesthetic. And then there's other little stuff, like you can enlarge a single app icon to fill up four spots on your home screen for a unique home screen grid. I don't know, you might be into that. There's also this nice little animation with the folders on the home screen. Also this new thing which
lets you add a glass effect to your wallpaper, so it's blurred behind your home screen for better visibility, I
actually really like that. There's also AI wallpapers now, so you can jump into the wallpaper studio and create the most soulless combo art the world has ever seen
in just a few taps. There's also third-party icon pack support on the home screen, with
instant one-touch previews. And then of course the glyphs. So, this phone still has
some lights on the back, it's less lights that the
flagship, than the phone two, but, about the same
amount of functionality. So there's one vertical
light on the right, and a small one down
here on the bottom left, and then the big top one
arcing around the top left. This is the one that works
with the glyph countdown timer. Maybe you'll find that useful. The blinking notification
glyph when your phone is down, I still wish I could just
customize it a little bit more, I know they don't wanna do
RGB, but if this was RGB, I would totally have different colors light up for different app notifications and I would go to town
with that, but, you know, it still works with just white lights. And it also does music visualizations to sync up with any music
coming out of the speaker, so... (phone plays electro-R&B music) I don't know. Sure. Obviously some of this stuff is gimmicks. Some of this you may find
useful like once or twice, I almost never use the countdown clock, but the one time I use
it, it's kinda cool. Side note, I couldn't
get the glyph composer to work at all on this phone. The UI worked, but it didn't light up
the lights on the back. But you know, on super closeup photos, maybe the glyph fill flash
is decently useful sometimes, useless other times. But hey, while we're on
the subject, the camera. The cameras on the back
here are serviceable, like, it's just practical to have cameras on the back of your phone, and these, they're not
good, but, they're fine. I always feel like we go
into budget phone reviews kinda knowing, okay, this isn't gonna have
cameras that blow me away, it's not gonna be as
interesting to test these, but, you gotta test 'em anyway
and see what they're made of, so, this has a different new 50-megapixel primary
camera on the back, and then it has the same ultra-wide camera as the Nothing phone too, and actually also the same selfie camera. And look, it can take okay pictures. Alright, passable pictures. I know 50 megapixels is a big number, but, here's what I'll say: at this level, even in great lighting, the photos aren't particularly sharp. The dynamic range or depth
of field aren't amazing. Like, you're not buying this phone to take the greatest most
artistic photos and videos the world has ever seen. But, what you do need is
for it to be serviceable, to be quick enough for autofocus to work, for it to capture a moment,
document scanning, video calls, sharing photos with people. And it does all that,
and it's totally fine, and I can't complain. And really what's left a
bigger imprint on me using this is that, compared to their
other flagship phones, almost all of the features are still here. Like the only one I'm not actually seeing on this budget version of
the phone is macro mode. And that, that theme of
keeping a lotta the stuff from the more expensive phones and not doing these artificial cuts, that's what feels good about
this phone as a budget phone, to me, it actually feels like
they're trying to give people all of the Nothing phone
experience for less money. Now, we definitely can't
say it's one-to-one, there's obviously cuts,
especially with hardware, Like there's no wireless
charging, like I said. It's IP54 instead of IP68. It's plastic instead
of glass and aluminum. But, I like that once you
start to get to use the phone, especially with the software
features, experience wise, I don't feel nearly as many
artificial-feeling cuts as we've seen on other phones. Like there's no pro mode in the camera that's missing from the budget phone. All the same advanced settings,
the experimental features, all the home screen
features with Nothing OS, it's all here, on this cheaper phone. And the crazy part to me is, they obviously wanna compare
this to a lower-end phone, so they compare it to the Phone 1, and my natural instinct is
like, ""I'm ignoring that, ""of course they're comparing
it to the old phone."" But when, you actually look
at that 2-year-old phone, you kinda see how far they've come. And you look at the things that are actually better
about this budget phone. This Nothing Phone 2A has
a bigger, brighter screen, with thinner bezels. It has a larger battery,
with faster charging, a higher-processor clock speed, a higher-resolution front camera, and a wider variety of refresh
rates than the Phone 1. Like, no wonder they
wanna show us the Phone 1. But, in general, if you're
looking for the TLDW, yes, this is a good, solid,
all-around budget phone. And the way Nothing has
been tracking with software, it appears, I mean they're promising three years of Android
updates with this phone. I think this will be a
good budget phone to own for the next couple years. Well done, Nothing. Well done. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one.

piYf4gDthjY,iPhone 15/15 Pro Unboxing and Second Look!,iPhone 15 unboxings and early thoughts on some of headlining features Get a dbrand Ghost Case at ...,2023-09-19T13:01:15Z,8005094,217456,9983,"- All right, so this is an iPhone 15 and a 15 Plus and a 15
Pro and a 15 Pro Max, every new phone in the lineup. New colors, new materials, new ports. There's some good stuff to unbox here, so let's do it. So starting with iPhone 15 and 15 Plus. This iPhone 15 here is the
new blue color, and it is, I'm just gonna go ahead and rename this color to barely blue. I think that's an appropriate name, because it really is barely
giving hints of blue. You can really see it
on the side rails too. But yeah, really subtle colors
across the board this year. Anyway, the other things in
the box are the paperwork, the single white Apple sticker, and there is no SIM card ejector tool here since they're all eSIM,
at least in the US now. But most importantly, the
new cable in the iPhone box for all new iPhones is a single, white, braided
USB-C to USB-C cable. I think this is the first time the iPhone is shipping with a braided
nice cable like this. So hopefully it'll be a higher quality and more durable than old cables we've been getting for years. So, cool, USB-C cable, USB-C phone. Now, if we take a look at the Plus, same idea, bigger box, but this new incredibly pale yellow. I mean, again, in perfect
lighting at the Apple event I think it looked a
little bit more colorful, but it just looks extremely pale out here. And then we've got the Pro boxes
for the Pro phones as well. Still white boxes, but dark wallpapers. So the iPhone 15 Pro I have
here is the new dark blue color. I almost want to call this
one barely blue again, but this time it's darker and kind of borders on gray when the light hits it
from certain angles. Very safe. Same stuff in the box after that though, the paperwork, the white Apple sticker, and the new braided USB-C cable. And then our iPhone 15 Pro Max here is the new Natural Titanium color. And I gotta say, guys, I think this is gonna be the one to get. It's the best color in person in the hand. I'll talk more about why in a minute, but there you have it. The slightly new unboxing experience on iPhone 15s and 15 Pros. So by the time you see this, I've been testing these
phones for about six days now. Not quite enough time for
a review by my standards, but still plenty of time to give you some interesting thoughts, some things that I've picked
up on, and some quirks. So first of all, these pale colors. I don't really know how else to say it. Like, this might be totally fine with you. I always get told everyone's gonna put
a case on their phone, which they probably are. But hey, Apple did spend
a ton of time and money making this new softer touch
satin finish on the back, and some of us, some of us will carry our
phones around with no case, so it's worth mentioning. For the Pro phones there's actually an extra
layer of interesting though, because they've switched
that rail material, the part that you actually
touch on the outside, from shiny stainless
steel to brushed titanium. We've all heard about
how much lighter it is, and it's something like 10% lighter, which is enough for me
to notice and enjoy. But the other thing is I
thought the brushed finish would sort of eliminate
fingerprints on the sides. Absolutely not. I was wrong about that. I mean, it's less, it's not as bad as stainless steel, but especially on these darker colors like the black or this blue, you can totally see fingerprints and sort of where your hand oils are marking up the sides of the phone. And then on top of that, this is not anodized
like aluminum might be. This is the new PVD coating
they talked about on stage. And it's only been a week here for me, and so I don't know exactly how well this will hold up over time, but what I do know is if you get a scratch deep enough into this coating, it's gotta be the Natural
Titanium color underneath, which is very light. And so that might look rough, if you drop this phone with no case and get like a big gash
on your dark colored phone and have light marks all over it. All of that to say, I do really think that this
Natural Titanium or the light is gonna be the better color
to get on the Pros this year. Okay, some things I've
noticed in my first week. So first of all, on the Pro, the bezels are technically
a little bit thinner, which makes the body a little smaller, but you really don't notice
that much after a few minutes. What you do notice more actually visually is the slightly softer curves all the way around these phones, seriously, on the 15 and 15 Pro. Because on the 14 it was so square, like it just went straight to
the edge with a flat display and then it dropped right
into the rail at 90 degrees. On these new phones, the edge of the front glass actually has a little bit
of curve at the very edges, so it's a softer curve into the rail. Then the rail itself has softer curves than the totally sharp
corners from last year. So I think it's a nice hybrid of making it just more comfortable in the hand with these curves, but still keeping the generally boxy look. Now, with USB-C on these phones, we already learned that you
can just plug in a cable to charge an accessory, right? So it's no reverse wireless charging, but you can at least plug in a USB-C cable straight to AirPods or an Apple Watch MagSafe
charger, whatever, and it will charge from
your phone's battery. So that's already pretty interesting, but I decided it's worth learning all the rules and behaviors of plugging things into the iPhone 15s. So here they are. So if you plug in any
older Lightning iPhone into a USB-C iPhone, regardless of the charge state, the USB-C iPhone will always give battery to the Lightning iPhone, every single time no matter what. Now, if you plug in another USB-C iPhone into your USB-C iPhone, it actually does a handshake
where they talk to each other, figure out which one
has the lower battery, and then the one with the
higher state of charge goes, ""All right, I'm a battery bank, and I will start charging the one with the lower stated of charge,"" all the way till you unplug it. So I thought that was pretty interesting and it works pretty well. Then I decided to try a
couple of Android phones and see if the same handshake happened. Basically what we found is if you plug into your
friend's Android phone who has more battery than you and that phone has USB PD, it will actually act like a battery bank. But if the phone doesn't have USB PD, which is a bunch actually right now, it's pretty inconsistent and you could end up charging it or it could end up charging you. Literally unplug and try it again. But if it has USB Power Delivery, it will actually do the same
handshake that the iPhones do. It's only 4 1/2 watts out, so it's not huge. It's not gonna fast charge or anything. But, you know, it is
ideal for accessories. You can literally use the cable in the box to charge up the new AirPods or whatever else you wanna try. But yeah, you can rescue
another smartphone in a pinch. So then the new Action button on the Pros. I was very curious about this. I was not sure if it would
have some restrictions or if there's some things
that it wouldn't let you do, and it turns out I haven't
been able to find any so far. It seems like it basically
lets you do anything you want, and I'm very happy about that. I mean, this was a feature of a lot of Android phones in the past. There were some LG phones that did this, some Sony phones, I wanna
say some ASUS phones. I'm hoping it starts to make
a bit of a comeback here, because on this new iPhone it is great. So you jump into the settings and go to Action button, and it loads up this whole crazy UI that's just nothing like any
of the other settings pages on the iPhone, like they just stapled
this in here, but okay. And as I showed you in
the impressions video, you can do any number of pre-programmed things with this button. By default, it is still the
mute switch that it replaces, and it has those two
different haptic patterns. So when you mute it in your pocket, you know exactly what you're doing without even checking
you did it correctly. But honestly, I don't know. I leave my phone on mute
most of the time anyway. So you can also have it open up the camera in any of the camera modes. But then again, the camera shortcut is, like, right on your
lock screen already, and I'm pretty used to that. Same thing with the flashlight. You could do that, but it's also already on
everyone's lock screen. I like the voice memo trigger. It's actually pretty convenient because it immediately starts recording when you press and hold the button. But my favorite by a mile is
the Siri Shortcuts function because it basically lets
you do anything else. You can stack up a bunch
of different functions that are, like, location dependent, or you can have it call a certain contact or do certain things, or if you just wanna literally open any app on your phone with zero lag. So it could be your to-do
list app or your calendar app or just open YouTube with
any one button press. Whatever you want. For me, I'm gonna map my Action button on my brand new iPhone
to the Google Assistant, the best assistant
available on the iPhone. Also, Apple, if you're listening, I also wish you could map a double press or a triple press of the Action button to a new specific function. Just think about it. Also, I was kind of curious how cases would handle
this new Action button. So I asked channel sponsor dbrand to send over their new Ghost case, and I have it here. Personally, pretty solid. I think this matte black
skeleton design looks sick. And yes, I can confirm
that even with the case, the Action button still
feels nice and clicky. Now, I might be thinking, all right, what's so special
about this clear case? I've seen a million clear cases. And between the skeleton and MagSafe, there's a bunch of other stuff, but my favorite personally is if you've ever owned
a clear case before, you probably know that after a while it kind of ends up looking like this, which is disgusting and yellow. But dbrand has promised me that they've specifically
engineered the Ghost case to be impossible to yellow, and they use those words themselves. So they actually give you a lifetime case replacement
guarantee if it every yellows. So that's either a real promise or free cases for life, the way I see it. Either way, if you're interested, I'll leave a link below the like button if you wanna check it out. That's the dbrand Ghost case. Now, I've also been taking
some pictures and videos with these new cameras to get a sense of how they perform. I will be taking many, many more, posting them on on Twitter
if you wanna follow me there. Instagram as well. I also fully plan on shooting the next Auto Focus car
channel video with this phone, so you already know you
can go subscribe over there to see how the video looks, to hear how the microphones sound. One thing that they did mention
in the keynote specifically was there was a new
coating over the lenses that I immediately thought, oh, does this fix the horrible
nighttime flare issues with the iPhone's video? First thing I did was go to a dark room, bring it out at night,
shoot with some lights. No, it didn't fix it, unfortunately. I'm sure the coating does some other great
stuff during the daytime, but there's still flare issues, sadly. But also, lastly, I wanna clarify the new camera
behavior on the Pro phones. In the impressions video, I was a little down on the whole, like, 1x versus 1.2x versus 1.5x thing, because I thought it was
literally just a digital crop, which would be pretty pointless to me. But it's actually closer to a
set of Super Res Zoom presets that you can actually then
digitally zoom between. I'll detail all of this
in the full reviews. And here's some benchmark scores in case you're curious
about that sort of thing for performance for the A17 Pro, which is actually new. But generally, I think that wraps up my first, second impressions, my second look now that
I got 'em in the studio. Really I feel like the base iPhone 15s, if you wanna buy one of
these or pre-order 'em, it's a bigger improvement
than it seems on paper. Like, nothing is actually new here, but because it's bringing things
from last year's Pro phone, it's actually a very solid phone. And then the Pro, it's
a lot more interesting because there's some
genuinely new stuff happening. I've seen new stuff with the cameras. Also, it seems like someone found out the batteries are slightly
bigger across the board, which is good too. We'll see if that holds up. But generally, let me know what you wanna see in the full reviews in the comment section below, because I will be working on those over the next couple days and weeks, and hopefully you'll see that soon. Either way, thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace. (mellow electronic music)","What 2 phones do you use mk?

lRUtHtqfCGA,Nothing Phone 2 Review: A Real Personality!,"The Nothing Phone 2 has a neat design, but it's really more about the software. Threads: http://threads.net/@MKBHD MKBHD ...",2023-07-13T15:34:54Z,3738498,106845,4131,this is a nothing phone 2. you can tell because the glass on the back is rounded a bit otherwise it looks pretty similar to the phone one but don't let that fool you [Music] you know humans are very visual creatures and when the nothing phone 2 design was revealed by this YouTuber I was going through a lot of the comments and a lot of people were actually disappointed that it looked so similar to the phone one like oh they barely they barely changed anything but I think that's actually missing the point like don't get me wrong I understand that people of course want an exciting new design but think about it if you're a brand new company like a two-year-old smartphone company and you're trying to establish your your ID your DNA for the way your phones are gonna look you can't dramatically change things that much year to year if your second phone looks wildly different from your first phone it's kind of hard to establish that you know so yeah the glass is a little more curved and the gray is lighter and there's some adjustments to the LED zones and we'll get to that in a second but generally it still looks like a nothing phone and that's on purpose but second of all the design it matters but it's not the only thing that matters and actually a lot of the changes with this phone are more than Skin Deep so using this phone for the past two weeks I do think overall it feels more premium I'll say it doesn't necessarily show in the specs but it's a collection of things that have all been bumped up the display is now much brighter up to 1600 nits so it's much more visible Outdoors still 1080p 120 hertz but it's ltpo this time around and they move the selfie camera hole punch from the corner to the middle and the bezels are a little bit thinner all the way around making room for a slightly larger display just a little bit more refined I also still wish the optical fingerprint reader was a little higher up on the screen and a little bit faster but honestly still par for the course as far as phones in this price range along with the ip54 water and dust resistance overall similar phone slightly better but most of the changes with this guy are under the hood so let's go there first of all they picked the Snapdragon 8 plus gen 1 essentially a last generation Flagship chip this means it's much better than the previous phone but not quite up to date with some of the highest end phones today rocking the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and then the base version has 8 gigs of RAM but this version I've been testing has 12 and it's been excellent very smooth all the way around I mean I've been leaving on the dynamic refresh rate setting and it feels like it's 120 hertz most of the time it's very responsive it's great it did occasionally hang sometimes and I've had some weird one-off bugs that are hard to replicate including more thermal warnings that I'm used to seeing in a phone especially while wireless charging but overall it's been pretty solid and that brings me right to the software experience with this phone this phone has a lot of character like there are a lot of little like tweaks and UI things and features stuff that they've added that made me go oh like that's really nice like I like the fact that you can choose how large an icon is on your home screen so if you want to have a you got a nice little grid array going on and you have an app you open a lot you can make it double sized and just kind of tucks into your grid like it's the size of I guess four icons they redesigned how folders look on the home screen I think it also looks really good you can add any Quick Settings as a widget on your home screen which is dope I don't know why I never thought of that and then even better is lock screen widgets so for this it's only nothing's widgets but they have a pretty good variety of them a lot of weather widgets clocks and things like that and they literally stay visible all the time with this nice little dot matrix version on the always-on display so I love having the weather up here and then the quick shortcut to the flashlight it would be cool if third-party apps could plug into this too but for now it's already really neat there's still the nothing dot fonts everywhere and the dot Motif with the brightness slider and the volume slider things like that and then of course on top of all of that you've got all the glyph stuff some people are like this is a total gimmick some people are like this is the greatest thing ever I love it I feel like I'm somewhere in between so these LEDs are actually a little bit brighter and a little bit wider compared to the nothing fun one uh there's a slightly different design too so with the pair of LEDs around the cameras instead of one solid Arc and then the large C in the middle gets split up into six different sections but then as I mentioned in that dope Tech unveiling video there are more addressable zones for the LEDs on the back so meaning instead of just lighting everything up at once there are quite a few more software features now to take advantage of the more precise control stuff like the countdown timer and the progress indicator for third-party apps starting with Uber and zomato I got it right that time in addition to the charging progress indicator light at the bottom there's also long pressing the torch for the glyph flashlight which is kind of sweet it's actually it's not as bright but it's much softer and there's also the essential notification light so you can assign that top right stripe to light up and stay lit up anytime you get a notification from one specific app Choice until you address that notification and the glyph composer of course to build your own notification sound do I think it's a little bit gimmicky yeah for sure there's definitely some some weird novelty that you're probably not going to use but I think among all that stuff there's at least some pieces of it somewhere that some people will find useful I guess I just don't understand how hard could it be to give people more full customization control of the lights like you can okay if I have one app that I really know I want to pay attention to then that's the one stripe up here but what if I have three or four apps and I just want to make sure I assign them to three or four different lights on the back like because that's an impossible engineering challenge or do they just not want us to be able to do that for some reason I don't know but you can't either way I want to get back to what I said before which is that this phone has character for real so this is all part of nothing's self-titled nothing os2 but to be more specific it's basically nothing's skin on top of Android 13 right now and I kind of feel the same way about it that I do about Google pixel like the pixel has its own character version of Android and this phone kinda also has its own character version that's present throughout the experience you know it's a London based company so it says things like airplane mode and color correction and the trash in Google photos is called the bin it has the monotone desktop icons by default which always start off so promising and every time someone tries to do it I want it to work so bad but then there's always just a few apps that are not supported and ruin the look this is also true here but I really respect the clear back thing I've been pretty pumped about some other transparent gadgets lately and somebody pointed out the uneven glue in the hinge of the Beats Studio buds plus case and I haven't been able to unsee it since but really that made me appreciate more that nothing is doing a ton of transparent themed stuff and even added a transparent cable this year well the ends of the cable not the actual cable but still kind of cool and you don't see other companies doing the clean neat transparent stuff this well so then I guess let's just get to the meat of this to the most important things with any new phone are going to be battery life and cameras and battery life on this new phone is much improved the cameras not so much so the battery situation actually is awesome it went up from a 4500 to 4700 milliamp hour battery it also went to a more power efficient newer chip and it's bumped up to 45 watt Peak charging so even with the higher fresh rate on a higher screen brightness and all sorts of new apps like threads coming out where I'm spending like hours of screen on time per day follow me over there I guess uh turns out this thing can keep it going for six seven hours of screen on time no problem and when you do plug into a fast charger which is not included in the box but when you do it's pretty quick it can go from zero to full in an hour and there's even 15 watt wireless charging like I mentioned earlier it's the completely worry-free battery package even if it does overheat a few times on that wireless car charger so then the camera's back here on the other hand we're a little bit more of a bummer a bit inconsistent for me so still dual camera is still a primary camera and an ultra wide no telephoto and they've upgraded sensors now so 50 megapixels each but it's not it's not the no number of pixels that matters it's the quality of them so I think it's more helpful context to know this is the Sony IMX 890 for the primary sensor which is the same one that's in the OnePlus 11 and the OnePlus nord3 this is a very average camera system in perfect lighting like the aperture is wide enough and the sensor is big enough that you get some good looking photos with shallow depth of field and when the subject is up close they look good colors are solid and processing isn't too dramatic so when you take landscape shots too things look sharp across the board but two things I've noticed one is in lower light it starts to fall apart more you either get more noisy or more soft photos pretty quickly not a shocker we've seen this before and in the premium mid-range space that feels kind of like again par for the course right below the impressive pixel 7s and the not so impressive OnePlus Norris of the world but the other thing is it has this weird bug that I've seen just a few times where a moving subject has this weird ghosting which is not good it I'm guessing it's a weird laggy HDR processing where it's trying to combine frames and it has some sort of a weird lag while capturing those frames either way I haven't seen this bug in any other phone camera in years hopefully it's just that a bug that they can fix and along with those other quirks and weird things I've talked about they can iron that stuff out before shipping this phone to the world and also one other quick random thing that didn't quite fit in the rest of this review the haptics for the keyboard are very strong which is fine but I can't adjust them and they're so strong you can actually hear them if you can it's not the sound of my hand hitting the phone that's like the sound of the vibration motor being too strong I just want to be able to adjust that I can't find it in the settings please nothing let me adjust the haptic strength of the keyboard but anyway the last big pillar clearly is the new price so the previous nothing phone started firmly in I would say mid-range territory it was 399 Euro and this phone starts at 599 U.S so it's bumped up and that's actually for the starting one so that's eight gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of storage that I just turned the torch on of course I did um but I think once you bump up to the 12 256 you quickly get into 700 phone territory so is that actually worth it it's a much more expensive phone and I think the answer is if you think worth it is purely a Specs question then you probably won't see this phone as worth it it doesn't have the most amazing specs in the world uh matter of fact I can kind of already see the two sides of how people will Embrace this phone like you'll have the our Android community on Reddit saying okay this is basically just an average mid-range phone nothing too special quirky design whatever and then you'll see you'll have like the the nothing investor Club being like this is this is the greatest design ever in a phone it's the coolest thing ever made the truth per usual Falls somewhere in between matter of fact I think the funny thing is both those groups probably have in common that they probably haven't used the phone yet and I think once you do and you actually get used to it you realize that the specs and the design are both not the primary thing about this phone when we actually use it it's really the software it's absolutely defined by this character filled software and that part even if it's a little buggy is really fun it's really solid so that's what makes it the nothing phone too thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace

w2KbwC-s7pY,Why Does the M2 Mac Pro Exist?,In a world where you can get the exact same performance from a computer half the price... what's the point? MKBHD Merch: ...,2023-06-28T20:15:56Z,2810230,83135,3229,[Music] so Apple's done it they finally completed their apple silicon transition they said it would take two years it took closer to three but now every single Mac that was running Intel processors just a few short years ago is running Apple silicon from the top to the bottom of their lineup and the very last one to get it was this one right here the new Apple silicon Mac Pro and it got it in a weird way so let's talk about it so there's a whole lineup of Max and the bottom of the lineup was the MacBook Air and the Mac Mini getting M1 and then M2 just this the base smallest version of Apple silicon on a chip already a massive improvement over the Intel machines but then the further up you go you get the MacBook Pros with M2 Pro this is double the M2 then the M2 Max is again double the M2 Pro and at the top of the lineup is the new King of the Hill most powerful chip they make in the new Max studio which is called the M2 Ultra which again double levels up the M2 Max literally I mean it's two M2 Maxes fused together this ship is absurdly impressive which shouldn't be a surprise I mean the M1 Ultra was already awesome and it's what I've been editing on for basically the past year it's been out but M2 Ultra is actually meaningfully better at a lot of stuff than that one it's a solid 15 to 20 faster on single core performance which is already excellent taking it to the highest Mark of any Mac ever and it also benchmarked 15 to 20 faster in multi-core CPU performance again making it the fastest Mac ever tested it got better scores in everything across the board geekbench metal scores are up by 20 in the GPU department now that it has this new 76 core GPU which is the one I'm testing and there are even certain software optimizations that improve workflows even more than expected so the New Media engine is a good one where it would typically Excel mainly at parallel workloads like that's why you'd always see them talking about 22 8K prores videos at the same time or whatever it was but it can now also Point all of its core is at a single workload for those of us doing back-to-back exports instead of parallel exports so the export time for a sample project I built with five minute prores video went down from a ridiculous one minute 45 seconds all the way down to a hilariously fast 57 seconds which is something like an 80 Improvement it's amazing M2 Ultra is truly excellent so then the Mac Pro would be the last Mac to get the Apple silicon upgrade and when it finally did look a lot of us Hardware nerds were getting really excited about maybe something like a M2 extreme which would once again double the M2 Ultra chip by fusing two together and being just something Mammoth and absurd but it didn't it didn't it's actually the exact same M2 Ultra chip in both the Mac Studio and the new Mac Pro so the natural question that this begs is why would anyone buy the new Mac Pro like why would anyone in their right mind spend 3 000 more dollars on a machine that gives you the exact same performance from the exact same chip in a much bigger heavier machine well I'll tell you why because I am one of them one of the few I'll warn you but one of the few people that will actually take advantage of some unique things about this new Mac Pro but the fact is yeah most people shouldn't and won't get the new Mac Pro because the Mac Studio exists so what's the reason well there are some smaller details that are potentially interesting about the new Mac Pro like for example okay it's the same chip in each but hang on a second they're dramatically different sizes so maybe the Mac Pro in a much bigger chassis with three gigantic fans at the front and way more space for airflow surely there's a slight thermal advantage to getting the Mac Pro or maybe more sustained performance over a longer time before throttling and technically yes I found that to be slightly True by only like a single digit percentage in most cases and often by a rounding error but I did do the cinebench 10 minute stress test back to back three times each on the Mac Pro and the Mac Studio and while the Mac Studio dropped a tiny bit on the second run and the Mac Pro technically increased slightly with each run suggesting it wasn't near its limit yet it wasn't really that dramatic like I've seen some people get maybe closer to eight to ten percent out of their tests but it's not enough to spend three thousand more dollars for more performance out of this machine put it that way but another thing is there is more i o on the Mac Pro technically I mean it doesn't have the SD card slot on the front unfortunately which is one of the most important ones but it does have a new card at the top here with six Thunderbolt ports and two more at the front so totaling eight which is two more than the Mac Studio and it also has has two HDMI 2.1 ports instead of one and two ethernet ports instead of one so technically true yes but also you wouldn't spend three thousand dollars more on the Mac Pro just for that I think people would get dongles for one extra Port but no the real difference the reason the Mac Pro exists is PCI slots like that's that's really it like the next time you see a comment or a tweet or something of someone going why does the Mac Pro even exist when you can get the same computer in a Mac Studio is because this one has PCI slots that's the real reason the Mac Pro has six open PCI expansion slots that the Mac Studio does not have five of them PCI Gen 4 the last one a compatibility slot it's kind of funny how empty it looks when you get it like you open this computer up and the entire thing is just air the M2 Ultra is just under this cooler at the top the CPU GPU shared memory the media engine neural engine everything is just under there and then there's just an expansive room for all these PCI slots and these PCI slots aren't even for video cards or gpus at all actually because as we know the GPU which has 192 up to 192 gigs of shared memory is built into the Apple silicon chip so really all we're getting the PCI slots for is expansion slots the pure dedicated expansion slots that a lot of Pros in certain industries use a lot sound cards i o cards storage cards networking cards that's it so yeah it is really specific and it will sound ridiculous to most people that it literally doesn't support video cards like you could pull a crazy AMD Radeon card out of the Old Mac Pro right now and put it into this thing and basically nothing would happen but also at the same time most of the buyers of these Mac Pros are you know Production Studios post Houses music studios things like that those people already had desktops with PCI slots and they literally could not make a Mac work unless they made one with PCI slots so that's who Mac Pro is for it really is too bad though that technically this Mac Pro will be less versatile than the old one because there are people who would want to throw powerful GPU cores at certain applications whether it's after effects or some 3D modeling stuff or Premiere even that just can't do that with this one it also doesn't work with or apparently even need the old After Burner carts so I don't know if you remember the afterburner cards and the old Mac Pro were basically these dedicated cars a two thousand dollar video accelerator card uh but apparently the M2 Ultra has enough power that it's the equivalent of like seven afterburner cards so that right there is the real power of Apple silicon if you're shooting prores but the more I think about it just so much of this Pro machine stuff is specific to workflows and it's it's very difficult to build one computer with no expansion or upgrade ability or modularity at all that works with everyone's workflows so there did need to exist a Mac that could accommodate some more interesting workflows but like I don't shoot prores I shoot r3d so I'm not going to need the exact machine that's built super well for Pro for me it's actually storage uh right here I'm holding owc's 8m2 PCI SSD this is basically a PCI expansion card with a bunch of nvme ssds on it so the max storage you can get built into the Mac Pro is eight terabytes and it's pretty fast it's six seven thousand megabytes per second read write cool uh but you can max out one of these cards at 64 terabytes and it will read right at 25 000 megabytes per second which is absurd uh so that's a totally different level this is what I'm going to dump footage on this is what I'm going to back up to this is going to replace my current external Thunderbolt backup which is where I was keeping all my old footage it was sitting next to the Mac Studio plugged in and I'll still have plenty of room left over to work on and edit multiple video projects off of it at the same time it's going to be awesome for what I do and I only need one but also I fully acknowledge and you should all realize that most people don't need those specialized ssds that's why it looks crazy that this Mac Pro exists just on the website next to all the rest of the Macs but most people should get this one Mac Studio is kind of a revelation for Apple it's offering their top of the lineup performance for way less than the old top of the lineup and that's why most people should end up getting that one I do have one last thing though I have a theory if if I know anything about Apple it's that you can sort of predict the future pretty well based on the past and this Mac Pro is a pretty classic lazy refresh from Apple pretty similar to what they've already done like look at the MacBook Air when they first went from the last Intel MacBook Air to the first Apple silicon MacBook Air they reused the exact same design and just moved the new chip on the inside for all the performance gains then the second generation of it got the redesign same thing with the MacBook Pro right they took the MacBook Pro with the touch bar and just reused the same design new chip and then the next Generation got a redesign so now this Mac Pro has just done the same first half of that transformation it's the same exact chassis more or less as the Intel Mac Pro but I can expect the Next Generation now I'm already thinking about the M3 and that's probably kind of unhealthy but that's that's where my mind goes that's just my theory so anyway now you know why the macro exists now you know why I'll have one on my desk and I'll also leave you with this there was no other place to put it in the review but I did realize that this Mac Pro does something kind of weird when you take the top halfway off when it's still plugged in the old one didn't do it so I'm just going to leave you to it thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace [Music],"There's not too many PCIe cards for the silicon macs.

aTf7AMVOoDY,Pixel Tablet Review: Is Google Back?!,Google re-joins the tablet market with a clever trick. MKBHD Merch: http://shop.MKBHD.com Tech I'm using right now: ...,2023-06-20T11:47:24Z,3104993,85116,4060,thank you hey what's up I'm Kim BFC here okay I'm gonna make myself sound really old here just for a second but about 10 years ago there was a vibrant ecosystem of a ton of different tablets there's all kinds of tablets there is like iPads versus Android tablets all these fights going on there were small screen tablets big screen tablets and all the Android tablets were sort of anchored by Google's family of Nexus tablets so we had the Smash Hit Nexus 7 and the cult classic Nexus 10 but then Google kind of got a little bit lost with Android tablets and Chrome OS tablets a little bit in there for a bit and they made a few bad ones in a row and then they just gave up like they literally just gave up stopped making tablets but something else that's picked up a whole bunch of steam since then is a new product category Smart Home displays so Google bought nest and we've seen this Nest Hub and the nest Hub Max came out and this is a growing category every single month so at some point during all of this Google probably thought wait a second we're making all these Smart Home displays and what is a smart home display it's basically just a cheap tablet so what if we just made a cheap tablet that could turn into a smart home display and so that's how we got this this is the pixel tablet so I've been using this tablet for a few weeks now and look it's not amazing or super premium or high-end or exciting uh and neither are any of the other Smart Home displays but I do want to talk about it it's also a little bit interesting and underrated and how important this tablet could be to other tablets so let's talk about it so as a tablet this thing is pretty simple I really like the soft touch finish on the back this is the porcelain color and it hides fingerprints really really well feels solid in the hand it's actually made of metal but you honestly could never tell just holding it thanks to this coating but it's very basic single camera on the back corner volume buttons with the inset fingerprint reader that doubles as a power button up at the top there's a set of speakers on the left and right that sounds okay but really doesn't have much bass at all and the USBC Port is on the left hand side it's not too big it's not too heavy and on the front is an 11 inch 2560 by 1600 60hz LCD display with bezels just thin enough to hold it and not be a problem and the display does not get particularly bright and it's not the fastest thing in the world but it is running the same tensor G2 chip as the pixel 7s but I just I I cannot call this tablet fast not sure if it's under clocked or what's happening here but it behaves very much like a basic mid-range Android tablet and that's because that's basically what it is this is a 499 dollar tablet and it comes with the dock in the box that you can buy separately if you want to if you want an additional one for 130 so I would say tame your expectations here like it's it works and it's it does what it's supposed to but I would just I would say tame your expectations so this speaker dock comes on the box which I think is super cool and it's actually the only way to charge the tablet that comes in the box there is no USBC Cable in here it's just the dock which has a barrel connector that connects to the wall and the dock is basically it's just a speaker in a box really with some pins super simple the pins kind of retract a little bit when you touch them which is cool but basically the premise is there's some magnets in the dock as you can see here with this magnet paper and there's some magnets in the tablet which you can also see here with this magnet paper and so when you line those up and connect the dock to the tablet it just pops right onto those pins and the pins carry both power and data so now it's charging and the audio quality should be improved because it's now using the speaker in the dock it works pretty darn quickly too thankfully it's not Bluetooth pairing or anything it's just literally a physical connection for the the data so it's just like connecting like an iPad to a keyboard it just works right away it holds it at a pretty good angle too it's basically straight up and down it looks just like a nest home hub when you put it on the dock like that magnets are pretty strong you can pop it off with one hand if you want to I'm just uh I'm just glad that this comes in the box and isn't an additional hundred thirty dollars first of all the charging speed is up to 15 watts which is not that fast it's a tablet battery so it's pretty big takes a while to charge um and then the the speaker in here is not that great I would say it feels on par with like the nest Hub Mini at Best so the speakers in the tablet are uh like I said they're fine but they really lack a lot of bass and then when you add it to the speaker dock you're getting like 20 to 30 more volume but it's mostly just adding the bass back but it's not super loud here I'll give you a little sample not a ton of bass right [Music] all low end and it's quick too it's immediate as soon as I pop it off back to the speakers but it's not the it's not the loudest thing in the world honestly it's I guess it's fine this dock cannot be used as a Bluetooth speaker or anything else when a tablet isn't attached but honestly I don't think you'd want to it's basically just sits there and is waiting for the tablet to be attached to it what's funny though is it does help with the battery so the battery life on this tablet was decent for me but it did have particularly weak standby life for some reason it would drop like 10 overnight sometimes which could be a bug either way the idea is when you're done using it you can pop it onto the dock and it is literally just a smart speaker now if you really wanted to you could buy another one and put it in a different room and then when it's in the kitchen per se it'll show you certain things when it's in the bedroom it'll show you other things but it is a hundred and thirty dollars per Dock and I'm now starting to think that that's the more overpriced thing among this bundle so just know what you're getting into that but I think really what I realized is this docking feature is cool but it's not the most interesting part of this tablet for me it's the headlining feature because it's the cool thing that it does but as I was talking about there was this whole tablet ecosystem like 10 years ago and seeing what Google does with the software for this tablet could give us a window into how Google can anchor Android tablets again going forward so I was really curious about the software so here's what I found number one I really like the new dock the software dock so the home button at the bottom you can swipe up at any time and all the same gestures work like normal but there's a new gesture where you just grab the Bottom bar and swipe up just a little bit and that brings up a dock which is the exact same order of whatever apps you had in your home screen dock it also shows up in multitasking and then from there you can switch to a recent app or initiate multitasking by dragging something to half the screen to get two things going at once it works great it simple I use it all the time for going back and forth between two things quickly so I really like that then number two multi-user support is so sick and the iPad should seriously be taking notes on this so anytime you want either from the notification tray or from the lock screen or anywhere that you see that profile picture for your account you can switch users when you set up a new user at first you basically go through the whole setup process as if you're setting up a brand new tablet and then that second person can sign into their apps and set up their home screen and their widgets and everything and you can switch back and forth by logging into each one literally just with your fingerprint it's exactly as simple as it should be it could also totally be like one person's personal profile and business profile so you never get the two confused or I don't know just a profile for your burner accounts whatever you want to make it the point is tablets are often used at home and by families that have more than one person so the ability to just like log into your kids account and not have them worry about accidentally buying thirty thousand dollars of I don't know Minecraft credits or something it's a pretty obviously great feature and then number three of course Hub mode this is the mode that sort of pops up when you get it onto the dock uh that they had to build of course because they turned this into a Smart Hub I kind of end up just using it like a Smart Hub a lot of the time that it's on this dock I don't touch it as much I just use voice controls which all work and then I have a clock here you can do like a photo gallery type thing or rotating pieces of Art and of course the smart home display controls are available at the bottom corner but it just kind of lives like that I have it in the kitchen most of the time nice oh this is also fun fact the the first tablet that has Chromecast built in as a Target so you can use it as a Target to Chromecast things to it I would never do that but you can do that so the number four last but not least is the app situation this is something we talk a lot about with Android tablets and there was a lot of promise with this version and with this tablet that there would be a whole bunch of new tablet optimized apps and that that experience would be meaningfully different and it's not well I guess you could say it's a little bit true so Google can say that their own apps are now all optimized and take full advantage of the larger display so you know you can be confident anytime you open a Google app on this Google tablet it's going to look great and that's awesome but for all of the rest of the apps that make the world go round all the third-party apps all the stuff that you probably are thinking about when getting a tablet that you're going to use there is no meaningful difference in that situation right now so a lot of them are still uh big phone apps I would say Instagram is still a giant phone app Twitter is still a giant phone app Tesla is still a giant phone app Expedia stole a giant phone app cash app is still not optimized neither is Tick Tock it still kind of looks weird SoundCloud is like half optimized I guess Pocket Casts is also halfway there looking like a giant phone app overdrop weather is still a blown up phone app and the list goes on and on they have this thing where you can uh double tap the space to the left or to the right to move it over to the side to make it more one-handable but I mean yeah that's it it's just a big phone app the app ecosystem for Android tablets is still to this day even now that this has arrived it's still the biggest weakness of an Android tablet and the incentive it's got to be on developers of course but most of their incentive is to be as simple and streamlined as possible and if you can just make one iPad app that covers all iPads you'll do it but if you can make one tablet app it won't necessarily work on all Android tablets so the incentive is still kind of tough well actually there is one app that Google can say that they got optimized before the iPad and that's the calculator they did do a full scientific not scientific but a full-on calculator there's a history over here to the side there's the readout which you can change the size of a light and dark theme all this stuff it's pretty good your move Apple some other little random things that didn't quite fit into the full review uh when it's docked on the charger it default charges up to 90 not 100 but I do think that's smart IT preserves the battery life overall there's also no headphone jack on this tablet just so you know and then in case you're wondering the camera quality is very much in line with the rest of this tablet's Hardware pretty mid it's good enough for basic video calls and document scanning but nobody's shooting any movies on this thing at the end of the day though my conclusion is this two in one devices are typically they're funny because they're they're always like slightly worse at one of the things that they're trying to be this is a two in one device it's a tablet and it's a smart home hub so I was wondering as I got it like what is it going to be compromised at is it worse at one or worse at the other turns out it's a decent cheap Android tablet and it's a slightly below average speaker dock home hub uh but that's fine I think those two things are close enough together and are simple enough that it makes sense at least I would personally love a super high-end version of this I'd be so down for like a 120 hertz super fast nice premium tablet that also could dock whenever I want on a nice speaker and become like this high-end like Boombox thing but I also know that that would be super expensive and would have a much much smaller Target demographic and probably wouldn't sell enough to exist well so this is the thing that makes sense and I think it may actually sell a decent amount and we'll see how it does until the next one thanks for watching catch in the next one peace foreign [Music],"Have you used Slack with it? | 😍😍i really wish i could afford one | ""Big phone apps"" - not what I am looking for.  You just saved me several hundred dollars.  THANK YOU! | So it's slow and dim and $500... notice how every time he reviews a pixel product he glosses over all the massive negatives. Trust I noticed | The problem , is that when you are used to work with stuff that costs thousands  of dollars, everything else seems to be cheap. The tablet is good enough for what 95 percent of what people do with a tablet... Facebook, Instagram browse the internet watch photos or Netflix.  Done. | Can one use the tab and dock when not plugged into the electricity? For eg. When sitting in the park, and listening to a meditation, or chilling with ur fav music. Does the dock charge up so it could be used as such? I had a Bluetooth speaker, that could charge up, connect to my phone via Bluetooth and then I could use it in the park without plugging into electricity, so that would be a great thumbs up if this dock does that. ❤thanks for vid! | Wich is better ? This or sam 9 fe? | 5:18 i think it would be useful to have Bluetooth in the dock like if i watch film on the tablet in the bed the dock would be next to me on the bedside table and yes it would be nice to connect wirelessly | Google just does some super moronic head-scratching things. WHY, oh why would they not have made the base as good as the Max Hub base and speakers????? That is such a no-brainer!!!! ESPECIALLY for a product that's TWICE THE PRICE!!!!!!!! And if they already had the base of the Nest Hub Max, why not just put the magnetic hook up on that same base as a price saving method?????? Google acts like the stupidest tech company on the planet so many times. How could they not have thought of this???
However, to be fair, you're wrong about the other apps that you say are still ""phone apps"" because they don't take up the entire screen. There is a setting you can activate to make ALL APPS take up the entire screen when in landscape mode. So that's at least nice. My entire purpose for getting this, was to have a better Smart Home Hub Max, that can do MUCH MORE than the Hub Max. And for the most part I got that. I also got an open box deal on Ebay, where I purchased the 256gb version for less than $300. Therefore, I've come out ahead. But Googles insane misses on some of these products just drives me crazy, when they were so common sense. | 0:39 😂😂"
kvN5_GXlg2Y,Apple&#39;s Forbidden Words,There's a few words that Apple literally never says on stage. Just something interesting I noticed MKBHD Merch: http://shop.,2023-06-15T21:06:03Z,3279419,128571,5864,hey what's up I'm Kim BHD here and did you notice something I've been thinking a lot about this over the past couple years of watching Apple presentations and it just became much more obvious watching their latest which was WWDC because in this presentation Apple went through 45 minutes on stage talking about their New Vision Pro headset and they didn't say the words virtual reality on stage once and just in general there are certain words that Apple just refuses to say or generally doesn't like to reference at all in any of their presentations or any of their marketing and it's fascinating to watch so what are those words and why is Apple doing this so let me start with the why now obviously I'm not Apple so this is from the outside looking in but there are two really good reasons for why they do what they do or why they don't say what they don't say and those are control and comparison so control first I've already talked about Apple a big reason for a lot of what they do is being able to fully control over everything as much as possible and that extends to PR2 or it doesn't even have to be PR it's just smart branding but if you come out with a new product and you associate it heavily with a word that the general public already uses or that another company some competitors are already using heavily for a bunch of different things then you run the risk that the sentiment around that word might actually change and might actually have a downturn at some point in the future thus dragging the whole reputation of your product down with it so here's another commonly never used word in apple presentations AI Apple just doesn't say Artificial Intelligence on stage now if you want some contrast go back just a few weeks ago to Google's developer conference just a Google I O and they introduced a bunch of features on stage in Android and in Chrome and let's just say they weren't shy about what was powering it as an AI first company ai ai ai generative AI generative AI generative ai ai a-i-a-i-a-i-a-i-a-i-a-i-a-i so I mean pretty clearly they love leaning into that but apple on the other hand also introduced at their developer conference WWDC a bunch of software features in iOS and Mac OS and they use the words AI or Artificial Intelligence on stage exactly zero times they never said it now they did use phrases like machine learning and ML and they talked about how a Transformer model is being run local on device that will help auto correct in the new keyboard in iOS 17 things like that but at no point did they call themselves an AI first company or proudly Proclaim that they have a bunch of new features powered by AI to show us today nothing like that and I think that's because clearly AI is such a big thing that it kind of has this public Persona that also has a bit of a dark side it's got a it's a bit of a controversial word in some areas we've talked about how AI art is sometimes accused of stealing from real artists I made a whole video about that I'll have a link below um and so the word is so much that if you're appleing you care so much about your Public Image you don't want to risk attaching yourself to that word that you can't control so they just don't they literally just don't say it so that's control uh the other thing like I said is comparison and this is a funny one too with Apple so if you've ever watched an apple presentation which most of us have there are some pretty common themes that you see every time you see the high production value a variety of presenters unlabeled graphs Craig's power stance but as a tech reviewer one thing I've also noticed and I think any other journalist or anyone covering these companies probably also notices to a point is that Apple just kind of avoids comparing themselves or even talking about or acknowledging other companies or other products at all they kind of just like to pretend that they are the only company in the world and they exist in this little ecosystem of just Apple stuff and other stuff just sort of Fades away now there are a few notable exceptions to this rule like they do every once in a while mention oh our new laptop is X percent faster than the most popular PC laptop or something like that they'll do that once in a while but really in general they do it far less than the other companies especially actually have watched it a lot in the smartphone space if you watch another smartphone product unveiling a lot of them will do straight up spec comparisons to others and like just number comparisons you know our folding phone has a new 4 800 milliamp hour battery which makes it the biggest battery in any foldable in this category oh our new phone has a 200 megapixel camera which makes it the highest resolution ever in a smartphone oh our new display refreshes at 165 Hertz making it 20 percent more responsive than the next best thing all this stuff Apple doesn't really like to do this type of comparison instead they would much rather name everything now I'm not just talking about the products of course they name things like the iPhone and the mac and the airpods and the software also has extremely functional names you have iOS iPad OS Mac OS wash OS TV OS Vision OS but they also like to take technical achievements and Technical features and brand them put a name on them they name everything so instead of 120 hertz High refresh rate ltpo display we've got promotion instead of an optical fingerprint reader we have Touch ID instead of a large linear vibration motor it's a taptic engine instead of the latest version of glass from their supplier it's ceramic shield now of course everyone knows the value of good catchy branding but when you brand something for yourself instead of using the term that everyone else uses that specifically makes your version a little bit harder to compare to everyone else's so while all the other companies are talking about okay we got to 120 hertz but now we we've got 244 Hertz and now our gaming phone is 165 Hertz So it's 15 more responsive than their 144 Hertz and Apple's over here like we have Pro motion and this version of promotion is more responsive and smooth than any other Pro motion we've ever had like they hardly ever use ip68 or IP67 on stage as much as they just like saying it's dust and water resistant again and there's hole punch cutouts in the top of the AMOLED display of every other phone in the store but ours with our software on top is a dynamic Island there's actually a whole page of these just on Apple's site I'll link it below just just trademarked names of things that they've put their stamp on some are programs some are features some technologies there's a lot of them clearly they're not the only ones who do this but it's just the most consistent thing about all of their presentations and the cherry on top of all this is a lot of times Apple doesn't even really like saying at all ever what the actual spec is they'll leave it to you to find out later and Tech reviewers are really digging and figure it out but when's the last time you ever saw the milliamp hour size of an iPhone mentioned in the Keynote last time I checked they just don't do that ever they'll just tell you it's the longest battery life of any iPhone we've ever made that is the epitome of control and comparison now with the New Vision Pro headset that Apple just unveiled in particular it's interesting it's really interesting I made a whole video just on I got to try it and my first impressions with it if you somehow haven't seen that yet I'll link it below um but it's also pretty clear based on what we know that Apple has future plans with this to make it cheaper of course but to also make it smaller and higher Tech and better and better to the point where the tech sort of just Fades away and you have a pair of glasses that you look through and still have all the technology and function from so they never really want to call The Vision Pro a VR headset even though it totally is because of the Ambitions that they have to steer this this vision and the control that they have no pun intended towards mostly AR stuff so you'll see all kinds of Demos in the videos of a virtual reality headset with really good pass through like when you go into that theater demo for one like you're in complete darkness with a huge screen in front of you I mean that's literally a VR headset but they want to steer you so much towards thinking of vision as an augmented reality experience and that's much easier if you just never say virtual reality out loud at all the closest they got was talking about how you can spin the digital crown and fully immerse yourself beyond the dimensions of your physical room with features called environments and there it is they've managed to Brand virtual reality with a different name so they can control it and manage what it's compared to over time they also didn't say a whole lot about the specs on stage part of it of course is because this is something that's coming out uh early next year so it's not done maybe some things change between now and then but they still didn't say a refresh rate on stage they didn't say a field of view number in degrees like they avoided a lot of the things that pretty much every other VR headset and maker out there would put in their presentation but there was no shortage at all of naming things and setting the tone for how they want us to think about this headset going forward so the next time you're watching an apple presentation or some keynote there's a lot of impressive things to pay attention to you know the graphics the transitions the Drone shots the power stances but it's the words pay attention to the words thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace,"Interesting how they don't compare the M4 to the M2, just the M1.

laptops you see the Tesla Model 3 was the most important model for Tesla they had other more expensive flagships but this was the entry level attainable version for the masses and it quickly became their most recommended and best-selling car and it's the way that most people got into Tesla and formed their first Tesla experience but sneakily bigger cars are actually more popular and in America especially people can't help but want a version that's a little bigger a little higher off the ground so they did the obvious thing and made Tesla Model y it's built on the same platform as a model 3 but a little bigger and a little higher off the ground and pretty much instantly has rocketed up to the top of the lineup to the point where it's now the most popular new car on planet Earth see the MacBook Air was the most important Mac for Apple I mean they had other expensive flagships but this was the most entry-level attainable model for the masses and it quickly became their most recommended and best-selling Mac as the first first way most people got into the mac and formed their first Mac OS experiences but sneakily bigger screens are actually the most popular and in America especially people can't help but want a version with a little bit of a bigger screen so they did the obvious thing and made the 15-inch MacBook Air it's built on the same platform as the 14-inch MacBook Air but a little bit bigger screen and I predict it'll pretty much instantly rock it to the top of the lineup to the point where it is the most popular 50-inch laptop and the most popular Mac on planet Earth we kind of already know what the M2 MacBook Air is if you haven't already seen it I'll link the review right with the like button that covers it my only real question is going into the review of the bigger one were one is there any real benefit to the bigger screen how much better is it really and two are there any other benefits to getting a bigger laptop so I think the whole bigger screen thing is pretty clear there are literally millions of people who today go into stores and ask for a 15-inch laptop and when they did Apple would have to bring people over to the 16-inch MacBook Pro as their cheapest option which starts at twenty five hundred dollars so now they have this now is there a dramatically more information that can fit on the screen not really is it a dramatically better quality display than the smaller one nah it mostly just feels bigger uh bigger videos bigger movies bigger texts bigger Windows just just a little more room for everything to be a little bit bigger and you only pay for that really with a little bit of extra size as far as the laptop goes this thing is still 11 and a half millimeters thin and weighs 3.3 pounds it's super slim it's a quarter of a millimeter thicker and half a pound heavier than the smaller MacBook Air which I kind of mentioned this earlier but I forgot that basically already has 14 inch diagonal screens with its thinner bezels so you can really just measure out 1.3 extra inches diagonally to get to the proper 15.3 inch laptop size still it has decently thin bezels not the thinnest in the world still has the notch cut out for face ID I mean sorry no face ID it has just a webcam and a microphone it still just as Touch ID on the keyboard and nothing else about the display itself really has changed it's the same Tech the same pixel density the same brightness 500 nits 60 hertz it's fine the screen is fine it's just bigger so all right now that the whole footprint of the laptop is also bigger what more can you get out of that uh first of all sneaky slightly bigger track pad so the keyboard is the same size but actually the trackpad does get a little bit bigger which is nice kind of matches the larger display and also there is more room inside for speakers so Apple's added not bigger speakers but just actually a second set of force canceling woofers which would theoretically make the sound a little punchier maybe add some bass and I I can say it is louder it does get louder overall and have a bit more bass than the smaller MacBook Air but it's not like game changing I'm impressed that they can get loud without distorting but they are not close to the maybe unfair 16 inch MacBook Pro speakers but just to give you an idea of the context also some people have noted it looks kind of weird to have like no speaker grilles the left and right of the keyboard but the speakers are still in the same place as they were in the smaller one up in the hinge of the MacBook Air and then there's also more room inside for bigger battery and my experience actually lines up pretty well with what Apple said which is look it's the same chipset very similar laptop bigger screen and bigger battery sort of cancel each other out and you end up with roughly the same battery life as a smaller machine it has to say it's quite good full workday of battery life pretty much guaranteed multiple light days in a row no problem so then the last thing I wanted to test is actually is there a difference in performance between the small M2 MacBook Air and the big one since theoretically there is just a little more room inside for a little extra thermal Headroom like there's no way it's significant but these are very different size laptops and the old one when it was torn apart didn't have a heat sink so maybe there's room for a little passive heatsink in this one they're both fanless but I had to check it so in single core bursty performance I never expect to see any difference and I really didn't I ran off back-to-back geekbench 6 benchmarks small drop off after the first one for each but no noticeable difference but then I ran back to back 10 minute cinebench multi-core benchmarks which kind of just run continuously to test some more reliable sustained workloads and there was a slightly bigger dip on the smaller M2 air and so potentially yes over time this may add up to a bit more thermal throttling but my conclusion is you can see the numbers on paper but this difference is unlikely to be noticeable like I said they're both running the M2 Chip and most behavior on laptops like this is so bursty and short that they perform basically identically but if you do happen to get into those long multi-minit sustained workloads in a row like we're exporting a video editing a video gaming even then maybe you'd notice a little bit more out of this bigger one over time but you'll notice the bigger difference on the 14-inch MacBook Pro which is just a little bit above this one in price so if you know you're going to be doing workloads like that then you probably are looking at a Pro laptop but matter of fact let's just talk about what I think is the biggest X Factor with this laptop the biggest hurdle between this and being the Tesla Model y of laptops is the price so this Baseline version this little Starlight one which kind of almost matches this a little bit a little sand color starts at 12.99 and that is the base version which you you can't upgrade these laptops over time so you tend to want to get as much as you can out of the initial purchase this base version only has eight gigs of shared memory and 256 gigs of storage that can actually pretty quickly become a 1700 laptop with just a few clicks to upgrade those things and that's a that's pricey so there's a lot of Windows laptops that you can get at that price that will probably do one specific thing better than this one whether it's the XPS 15 with a nicer display or the Rog zephyrus which is going to be better for gaming and has more ports you can get flipping and folding laptops that spin over backwards and gaming laptops even but none of them will be quite the package that this this is which is a really thin and light daily 15 inch screen laptop like this is kind of just the ultimate Baseline for most people's activities so to have all those things sort of well-rounded into one the thinness and lightness the nice display the great battery life the impressive performance from the M2 that's what makes this the MacBook Air it's got the A1 build quality it's got the color matching braided magsafe cable which also connects to the 35 watt charging brick with dual USBC ports which you could actually swap out for a slightly larger 70 watt brick with a single port for faster charging that's a free swap on Apple site and of course you can't forget the ecosystem stuff the messages the FaceTime Etc all the stuff that plugs into Apple's World despite its potentially premium price people will pounce on this popular pick thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace [Music],"If you're visually impaired, bigger screens help | I don’t like the MacBook Air 15 inchs tbh, they are  too expensive for its specs and the MacBook Pro 14 M4 is now 100 dollars more for the same 512gb and 16 gb of ram, u can also find the previous M3 MacBook Pro for cheaper than 15 inch air and 100 dollars more than 13 inch m3 air with more ssd storage | 1:14 amen to that. | Amazing love m2 15 …go 5 6 year | Converts would maybe like a right hand number cluster in the 15"" 🤷🏽‍♀️ | The fact that it took Apple one and half decades to simply release a bigger Mac Book Air is absolutely mind boggling. Sometimes I don't understand how Apple is as profitable as they are with their sluggishness. | I sold a 16"" 2019 MBP (Intel chip) for one of these, and as a pro. Final Cut Pro X user, I really don't see any difference editing. I have cut multiple streams of 4K video (I do use an external SSD to hold media, so that helps) and Compressor might run a bit slower. But overall, the 15"" MBA, being quite a bit lighter, and the M2 chip overall faster than an optioned up Intel-based 16"" MBP, I am happy with this replacement. These are an excellent choice, I feel. | I went out and bought a M2 14in Macbook Air over the 15in, It was honestly just a no brainer for me given the price difference between the two. It also fits in my backpack for school a lot easier, and If I want a big screen then I just go over to my pc for certain things. This purely a machine meant to get work done, while also having a decent screen for things like youtube, tv, etc.
Maybe it has to do with the fact that I've used a base model Ipad for years that I honestly see 14 inches as a lot of screen space for things. | Is it a good laptop for djing?
If not, which one is? | You live in Kearny?"
OFvXuyITwBI,Apple Vision Pro Impressions!,"I tried Apple's first ever spatial computing device, a $3500 VR headset. These are my honest thoughts. Google Project Starline: ...",2023-06-06T06:39:07Z,18128639,534040,39291,foreign Pro I had about a 30 minute demo just using this new headset I had about a trillion questions so I tried to ask as many of them as I possibly could of Apple to get all the answers I could for you and for myself so without any further Ado let's just jump right in this is everything you need to know so far about Apple's new AR VR headset so the first question naturally what is it so first things first this is a first generation device from Apple which we don't see very often but it is an augmented reality slash virtual reality headset with a bunch of cameras and sensors inside that you strap to your face it'll start at three thousand five hundred dollars and it'll go on sale starting sometime early next year nobody's been able to shoot video of using it yet so I'm gonna have to do my best with descriptions here but fundamentally this isn't something that's paired to your iPhone or your Mac by default it's a standalone computer with an M2 Chip inside its own Wi-Fi connection a roughly 4K micro OLED display for each eye a set of speakers right above each ear on the band and then a dedicated new R1 chip which is doing all of the real-time processing from all the sensors that make this headset pretty special but we'll get to that in a second so all right then how does it work well basically we've seen VR headsets and AR headsets before it's uh typically there's screens on the inside and then on the outside there's some sort of shell which has some sensors on the outside that help detect what is in your room around you and help to see the controllers in your hands but with this one there are no controllers at all they're not making any for it there aren't going to be any optional accessory they're not even going to design any controllers you are controlling this thing entirely with your hands and your eyes and your voice so you put this headset on and basically all over the headset there are an absolute ton of sensors you have two main forward-facing cameras two down downward facing cameras two more cameras for the sides two infrared illuminators a lidar scanner a true depth camera these are all to keep track of what's happening around the headset and also to track your hands in front of your face and then on the inside there's also a bunch of infrared illuminators and infrared cameras that are purely there just there to track your eyes so there's actually a setup process before you even get the headset you basically measure you sort of scan your face with the true depth camera on the iPhone and it uses that depth information about your face to give you sort of a custom cut out this will be a process that you can do in Apple Stores but basically you get the headset with the custom cut out for your face if you have glasses there are some Zeiss lenses but you finally get the headset out and you put it on and there's some nice meshing on the back some fabric that stretches and is pretty breathable it's built extremely well with all this metal and glass and then once you get it going the most impressive thing about this headset the most impressive thing is the eye tracking I'm not even kidding this this eye tracking is sick so basically the eye tracking in this headset as it looks at your eyes and keeps track of where your eyes move around is the closest thing that I've experienced to like magic like I don't I normally don't call Tech things sort of magical or surreal like this but this was even for a pre-release product kind of unbelievable how well it does anytime you move your eyes around the UI it would immediately highlight and select exactly what you're looking at no matter how small the target was or what you're looking at and then when you want to select something all you do is take your fingers like this and just touch them together that's how you click so you look at something click look at something click so there's actually there's a calibration process when you first set up the headset you put it on for the first time where you basically just look around with your eyes at a bunch of different dots so it learns your eyes and then yeah from that point on you're just cruising you're sailing through everything by just looking at things and it feels like telepathic you just look at something and select it and that's it so this is how the whole UI works pretty much every other headset has the ability to use your hands to select things but most of them rely on the sensors on the outside to keep track of a set of controllers for maximum accuracy but this massive array of sensors on the outside of Apple's headset have done an impressively good job of picking up what my hand is doing kind of no matter where it is so like I said there's sensors all the way around the thing they're facing forward but they're facing sideways and facing down so I can just kind of rest my hand like wherever and look at stuff and click I don't even have to move my head I can just look at something and just click my fingers I kind of did it by accident a few times like I just sort of be sitting there and my fingertips would actually touch and I'd select whatever I was looking at but pretty quickly you get used to just just this just just doing this now there are also some text boxes occasionally you want to type something and so you can look at the text box select it and then a keyboard will pop up and you can look at the letters but also you can just look at a search box field and just start talking and it'll start filling in whatever you're saying because there's microphones on the headset and there's also something they're calling optic ID which is basically kind of just the fingerprint ID of the headset because it's looking at your eyes and everyone's eyes is a different unique biometric pattern and so you log in just by putting a headset on and it looks at your eyes so optic ID this thing knows your eyes really well so you've probably seen all these weird looking frames where you can see people's eyes through it like this this super weird thing that I've never seen in any other headset so what is happening here well spoiler alert it's not actually transparent it kind of looks like it's a glass transparent thing but it's not it appears to be because there's actually an OLED screen facing out this is what I would call a 2 way pass-through that's what I'm calling it see a normal VR headset we've seen is of course completely opaque usually it's like black plastic or something like that so in order to see through to your actual environment without taking the headset off like for picking up your controllers or walking around a room without hitting a wall they have a pass-through mode so it'll turn on a camera on the outside so you can see what's going on around you and some pass-through modes are better than others some will do it from a single black and white camera some will do stereo pass through from two cameras some will do color pass through the pass-through on Apple's headset is again the best I've ever seen in a headset it's stereo it's color it's sharp it's real time it's really good so then the eyes you see from the outside are actually an OLED display showing what your eyes look like to the cameras inside the headset so it shows your eyes like this whenever you're using any sort of pass-through mode and if you can see your environment it'll show your eyes so you're not actually like looking at someone's eyes but it kind of feels like you are kind of creepy a little bit I don't know it's the simplest way of explaining it if they're doing something fully immersive in VR like watching a movie or playing a game then it won't show their eyes it'll show this graphic over their eyes instead it's a really interesting look it's a it's a bold look I just have this like thought of like you're uh you're on a airplane and the flight attendant walks up and Taps you hey do you want any water and you just look up and your eyes shine through the headset it's just a weird thing I don't think it's smart but I don't think other headsets are gonna do it because most of them don't have it in the budget to have a screen facing the outside but then let's get to the burning question you've probably already been thinking what does it actually do so okay I'm sort of I'm separating this into three bulk categories that I made up and I'm kind of proud of here which are Computing content and connections now actually I should preface this all by saying this is a first gen product so right now the only apps that show up on the home screen are Apple's apps just like when the first iPhone came out with no app store it's just Apple's apps but the reason this is coming out or at least getting announced so early but it's not coming out till next year is to give this window for developers to start developing their own apps and making cool things for this headset to do that are way more interesting and way more functional but it does have a core set of functions so for computing I think this is the one that's probably the least likely to be used by most normal people but it is a pretty direct shot at what meta just did with the quest Pro the 1500 Quest Pro so you can use this thing as its own computer with web browsing Etc with these 4K windows in front of you that you can move around and do all kinds of stuff with your hands now this will be its own OS again it's not running off your phone or anything it's running a whole new operating system called Vision OS and it seems pretty similar pretty similar to iPad OS just in the fact that you know you're just touching things in iPad OS and in this headset you look at something and then you touch your fingers together and that's basically just like a normal touch but I was really impressed with the responsiveness again this was better than any headset I've seen with just your hands if I wanted to scroll through something like a safari window I literally in air would touch my fingers together and drag the window and it would scroll nearly in real time I would like throw it around like toss it catch it toss it the other way and start scrolling through things with my finger resizing Windows dragging the corners of things and I was super impressed with that too now if you're like me you might have also had some questions about the sharpness like do I really want to wear something like this for a long time to work like it's on a computer and I think I was also pretty smartly addressed they use a selective rendering based on the super good eye tracking so the computing power is basically focusing on sharply rendering the part of the screen that you're actually looking at while saving power on the rest it's pretty cool and it works so quickly that I did not notice it while using it and then the part you're looking at is actually very sharp like I said before they're super high resolution screens they're 4K I don't know if I have a number for refresh rate but it felt like 120 hertz and you know I fatigue will eventually become a thing with any headset you strapped to your face but this would be on the lower level of eye fatigue compared to what I've experienced with some others and then for even more heavy work this was kind of nuts but they showed it in the keynote apparently if you have a Mac and you want to do Mac OS stuff you can just with the headset on just look at your Mac and it will pick up what you're doing and it'll mirror the max display as one of the 4K windows for you in the headset and then you can even connect a Bluetooth keyboard and a Bluetooth trackpad and start working around like it's an actual Mac just with a bigger screen wherever you want at yeah ecosystem stuff so that's Computing I definitely got to try it but then of course there's the uh the connection stuff you got messaging you can type out messages to people just like as if you were on a Mac but there's also impressively FaceTime now I don't even know that this is necessarily better than a normal FaceTime holding your phone or like on a laptop other than the fact that I guess you don't have to be holding anything but you can have people's windows floating in front of you as you talk to them on FaceTime but you might also be asking wait a second if I'm not holding my phone in front of me what do other people on FaceTime see well the answer is they'll see a 3D rendered model of you that was scanned into the system from your iPhone that syncs up and matches the movements of your face with eye tracking and all the other sensors of the headset so I I got to try it it is it works okay so it's it's it's not as good as obviously looking at a person I just feel like a FaceTime you're trying to have like a personal connection with the person and this is obviously more personal than an avatar or like a cartoon of you but it's just it feels kind of somewhere in between it's kind of like a Google project Starline which I just did that video about a couple weeks ago if you haven't already seen that I'll leave a link with a like button so you can check it out but it feels sort of in that like uncanny valley you know moving 3D model territory instead of looking at an actual person it's kind of how I picture it but then last but not least of course content people are just going to watch content on this thing and I think this is the industry now that Apple's jumping into it that is poised to explode like we've had VR games and VR videos for a long time and apple is now also able to do this they of course put their own spin on it and they can use the power and the draw of the Apple brand to get content creators and big motion picture studios and sports leagues and all kinds of creatives to work to make content that looks really good specifically on Apple's headset and in Apple's formats I can personally save from My Demo hell yes I would watch I would pay to watch an NBA game Courtside in the VR headset the quality is good enough and obviously it's not going to be as immersive as feeling the energy from the crowd but you're not paying Courtside prices you'd probably pay is a total guess 10 20 bucks to watch an NBA game Courtside or have some subscription to do that I would totally do that and it would be fun but even with regular 2D content like movies just watching a regular movie you can totally just sit back put the headset on maybe even put some headphones on and just like on a plane seat just watch a movie as if you're in a theater for one which is pretty sweet there is that digital crown on the side that actually lets you spin it clockwise to move in more immersion and fully envelop you in the VR environment or you can turn it counterclockwise to bring in more of your real world environment with pass-through in your peripheral vision kind of a neat trick and then there's also this kind of weird feature where you can take 3D photos and videos with the cameras built into the headset itself and I did not like this one so there was a demo of like a a recording from a headset camera of a kid blowing out some candles on a birthday cake basically and I got to watch this actual scene in the actual Apple headset so because there's two cameras like front-facing there they can record stereoscopic 3D so you can turn on the recording and in that moment sit down and record a super immersive video and then when you watch it back in the headset it's like you're reliving this moment in 3D which can feel kind of cool but I just I can't get the image of like the dad at the birthday party with the headset on just recording things like walking around it just doesn't it's what kind of memory is that for the other people around you you know like I saw this and I immediately thought back to the the reasons we all know why Google Glass failed which is it was ahead of its time but it's also like they're walking around with a camera on your face and everybody knows that you have a camera on your face it just wasn't cool dad what are you doing why do you why are your eyes sticking out through the headset so all right the number one question I've gotten after I've actually tried this thing is is it any good is this headset any good and the answer is well yes some of the parts of this headset that I tried are actually the best I have ever seen in any VR headset by a mile specifically the eye tracking and the Hand tracking now of course it's going to be up to developers to really make it good but I think the foundational like how do you use it part is pretty amazing but that doesn't mean there aren't any downsides all right number one there was no haptics of course because you don't have controllers you're just doing everything with your hands in the air there's no way to have any sort of haptic feedback there was a demo that I did where like I stuck my hand out a wall on the other side of the room opened up and a dinosaur was back there and a butterfly flew out I held out my hand and the butterfly flew up and landed on my finger it could track and see all that information in the volumetric all the computation to make that happen was amazing but when the butterfly landed and I didn't feel anything there was that moment of like oh right this is a VR headset but then number two this was interesting this is pretty heavy this is a pretty heavy VR headset kind of the same way that um airpods max the Apple's metal headphones are heavier than most plastic headphones there's a reason why most other VR headsets are just plastic it's not because that's cheap it's because it's lightweight it's fatiguing to have a heavy thing on your head and this is a headset made of metal and glass it's heavy now it is also super well built like there is no arguing that but I do wonder about using it for longer than the half hour that I did I wonder if it would be more fatiguing to my head that's also actually why the battery isn't attached to it that would be a ton of weight to carry on your head so they connected the battery instead through a proprietary cable and that actually can sit next to you on the couch or in your back pocket and that brings us to the other thing the battery life two hours two hour battery life on the headset which is not that great it's not that long now there's a USBC port on the battery bank and you can plug that into the wall for infinite time but the second you unplug from the wall yeah two hours from that pretty hefty battery bank which is like okay maybe most people won't be spending a lot of time in the headset but you did also just show us apple and AD of people like watching a movie in the headset that's already like most movies are two hours plus so something we're thinking about there's just a two hour but I'm sure people will make bigger external batteries for this thing but two hours and then also I couldn't get a firm answer here on if there are fans inside or not but I think they're stands like they're certainly vents for fans anyway and if you're gaming for long enough or using it for long enough do those spin up do they ever get loud do they ever kill your battery that's kind of unclear but then of course the main thing that everybody's talking about it's expensive it's 3 500 so is that pricey yeah that's very expensive but this is the thing that is always weird with Apple products like there is no direct comp like I always you always say it's expensive but like compared to what and they they did this with uh the pro display xdr they've done this with even airpods Max a little bit but like there there are several things that this headset does that no other headset does the eye tracking the hand tracking that's super good even if an equivalent headset came along today and did all of the same stuff that this does hardware and software wise it still wouldn't have face time it still wouldn't have like looking at a Mac and then the ecosystem allowing the max display to pop up so this is kind of something that only Apple could pull off so bottom line you know I got to try it I thought it was extremely impressive but at the end of the day this is not a product for the masses I mean obviously right it's three thousand five hundred dollars it has the word Pro in the name too but this this feels like this series zero like the Apple Watch Remember When the Apple watch first came out the series zero where it's really going to be up to the first gen the early adopters and the developers to decide the direction that this thing goes to decide what people actually want to use it for and that'll shape the future versions of it that we may eventually get down the road then maybe someday there's like a a vision SE that's like 400 bucks that the masses will all adopt and it'll be this next Generation hit product Maybe but as of right now this is very much in the sort of early adopter people like me people like watching this video testing phase to figure it out so that's the Apple Vision Pro it's uh it's it's the rich person's toy and the developers Muse for right now but we'll see how far this thing goes in the near future it's coming out next year it's not that far off it's not that far away it's really interesting times either way this was also part of a huge entire WWDC keynote so if you want to watch my recap of the rest of that stuff ideally get subscribed because there's going to be a video recap of the biggest announcements of which there are many other things and also uh I'll shout out the waveform podcast to get subscribed there too because the next episode I'll just say it it's a banger it's pretty sick so hit sub hit like hang out in the comments that's been it for this one thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace,"10:30 looks like even Marcus got overwhelmed by the Tech thats inside of Vision

PCp1BmME6QA,How Does Sony Keep Doing This?,Sony Xperia 1 V will be underrated again... and I'm not sure how long this can last. MKBHD Merch: http://shop.MKBHD.com The ...,2023-06-03T17:12:19Z,6058292,164772,10608,foreign this is the brand new Sony Xperia one Mark V it's the one five the fifth one uh this is a fourteen hundred dollar pure Enthusiast phone from Sony uh I've been using it came out a couple weeks ago actually it was announced a couple weeks ago but it's not out yet but I've been really loving it so far and just like a lot of their other previous phones there's some incredible Tech here but I've had to take a step back and realize that these phones are endangered species for a reason like Sony phones were already a rare breed to start with I've talked about this before in past videos where I've reviewed the Sony Xperia 5 Mark II and the Xperia 1 Mark III and the one mark IV and the pro I Etc all these phones and this one are loaded with features and manual controls and Technology but they also all have like the smallest Target demographic like the narrowest band of people who will actually appreciate everything that they do and that's fine there's nothing wrong with a product like that existing but that also has me kind of worried see we lost HTC we lost LG this this is just in the past couple of years uh and YouTube commenters would probably have you believing that it was just the negative videos about the smartphones that single-handedly took them down even though there was huge corporations behind them and that's clearly not true but I would like to try something a little bit different today because I actually think Sony right now looks almost exactly like where Porsche the car company used to be so if we're being generous Sony smartphones today are like Porsche cars 20 years ago so Porsche was toiling away making expensive Enthusiast sports cars for years and they were sick they were really fun cars but also their sales numbers were anemic and the business itself was actually in danger so the strategy to oversimplify was just give the people what they want crossover SUVs are starting to blow up they're taking off in sales and they're becoming the most popular best-selling vehicle so they took a bit of a risk as a sports car company and built a Porsche crossover SUV that was a Porsche Cayenne that thing went on to become their best-selling vehicle ever by a mile and propped up the whole rest of the business well enough to keep everything else afloat so they could afford to also keep making the expensive and sports cars it was kind of sacrilegious at the time for Porsche to make an SUV but if you ask any Porsche fan today they're all glad that the Cayenne exists because it enables them to keep making the 911s and the gt3s and everything else that they love so much so hear me out Sony give the people what they want now importantly what I'm not saying is for them to stop making these super high-end Enthusiast phones but what I am saying is they need some sort of like Mass Market appealing phone that people like me can actually recommend to everyone so that they can afford to keep making phones like this so I'm thinking something in the six to eight hundred dollar range which isn't totally foreign to them they can do this and it needs to keep of course all the character that makes a Sony phone a Sony phone not just another generic 700 phone but really think hard about this so here's three things I would do or would recommend for Sony to make a Sony character Mass market phone the same way that Porsche made a Porsche character mass-market vehicle so number one with the phone itself you got a smartly slightly cut down those specs so this new Sony Xperia 1 Mark 5 I've been talking about it has a 6.5 inch 21x9 120 hertz 4K HDR OLED display it's kind of ridiculous it's one of the most technically impressive parts of any phone just like the last Sony phone and the one before that it's literally 643 pixels per inch it's the sharpest thing you'll see on a mobile device Sony is the only company I see right now putting 4K displays in their smartphones and there's a reason for it so for the mass market phone 1080p and I know it sounds sacrilegious because this Tony thing is always a 4K display but they did have the Xperia 5 Mark III which is also 1080p display and you keep all the Sony character around the display because it's not just the 4K resolution that makes this a Sony thing but there are also one of very few to be doing the tall 21x9 aspect ratio that makes it easier to hold and the flat panel with no curves around the edges and no hole punch and it's surrounded by large front-facing speakers because I don't mind a little bit of bezel they should keep all of that now some of you might also be thinking right now about the Xperia 10 series which is Sony's line of like more budget oriented 400-ish dollar phones those phones have 60hz 1080p displays I think this should be right in this sweet spot in the middle just do a premium mid-range 120 hertz 1080P and I'd also like to make it a bit smaller this is a six and a half inch display which like I said is on the larger side and while Sony's doing what they can to make it more reachable with 21 by nine it's still going to be tough for people to reach the top without some hand gymnastics mostly because the fingerprint reader power button is here and so if you unlock the phone while holding it like this it's unlikely that you can also reach the top with your thumb so I'm thinking getting it down to roughly a six inch phone maybe a little less 1080p display with Sony character around it all that's really the biggest spec to cut down really the only other thing you end up missing out on if you make a smaller phone is a slightly smaller battery but then you're going from a 5 000 milliamp hour battery and a 4K display to a 1080p display with a 4 600 milliamp hour battery so then number two and this is a big one a better automatic camera now it's specifically specifically automatic cameras so what you've probably heard me talk about in the past is do not get it twisted these are some of the absolute best cameras in any smartphone but they are because they are so manually controllable and customizable that's why the enthusiasts like me love these things and why so many people in that crowd will buy them but it's just a different world being in full auto so these have a lot of parallels to shooting with like the Sony Alpha cameras and then this Xperia 1 Mark 5 has some interesting new stuff they've moved up to a 52 megapixel sensor which is not a number you see very often but that's really just binning down to 12 megapixels with some extra room for stabilization and it is a 1.7 times larger sensor than the last gen with some new optimizations surrounding the sensor Tech itself it's insane you see by decoupling the photo diode and transistor from being housed in the same space they basically free up room to have a larger photo diode in the same area and that also lets them increase the size and overall performance of the transistor in its own layer all this results in better light sensitivity on each sensitive area and larger pixels on their own substrate layers which results in massively lower noise and improved low light sensitivity if you know how to use it so what's frustrating about reviewing these Sony phones is I can say all that and the enthusiasts will appreciate it but I still can't recommend a fourteen hundred dollar phone to the masses that still has a slightly confusing slightly subpar full auto camera mode like if you want to dig in and navigate your way around you can get incredible footage and photos out of these cameras in the more manual modes but on a Sony phone first of all there are three camera apps Cinema pro video Pro and Photo Pro and even in the most basic mode of Photo Pro that launches when you just hit that sweet dedicated shutter button it's a little more complex than most people are used to there's just a few extra unlabeled buttons there's just a few weird quirks like the photo modes are hidden under more but also night mode and portrait mode are down here at the bottom it's also weird that the shutter button doesn't blink at all when you take a photo I know it's just a tiny thing but regular people expect the viewfinder to Blink when they take a picture because every other smartphone does and for some reason Sony's doesn't it seems unnecessary but this auto mode it just has to be simplified even more than it already has of course right behind the dumb down Auto modes is a ton of other way more powerful modes all the manual modes all the Sony character is still there but for the masses I promise you they just want to like pull the phone out their pocket launch the camera real quick and take a picture of their friend or their kid their pet doing something silly there's something happened right in front of them they just want to take a quick snap and they want that to be the best picture possible just that Quick Auto One Shot boom and I even get a little bit bummed out by the quality of shots from Sony's straight auto mode because I know all the technology that goes into these cameras also Sony literally makes all these sensors so they should have the best vertical integration pipeline in the world but yet they still get blown out the Water by a pixel or a Samsung phone in these basic point-and-shoot situation Sony tends to overexpose a little bit they don't do HDR scenes as well as the others they were consistently near dead last in the blind smartphone camera test that I ran last year where you all voted on the best looking pictures without knowing which camera took which photo so Sony's full-blown auto mode despite having all this awesome Tech can still be pretty rough and fixing that would make a massive difference to making it for the masses so then number three last but not least treat it like a flagship Sony it would be great if you could copy the other's homework a little bit on this one here I'm not even going to get into the naming of the phones but you have to put out the phone a week maybe two weeks Max after you announce it like that I don't know how else to say it like I know there's a lot that goes into launching a phone and of course getting it into carrier stores in certain markets and international markets and getting everything to work but you I think you really need to do as much as possible behind the scenes so that when you reveal the phone as soon as that hype wave starts to Crest people can buy it one to two weeks later tops now Sony believe it or not is making some progress on this it used to be six months of a gap between announcing the phone and it going on sale can you imagine that it's like a phone gets announced in April and you can't actually buy it until like October it's absurd but then they got it down to five they got it down to four this phone was announced May 11th but B H has it estimated for July 28th that would be still almost three months after the initial unveiling which is better than it used to be but that's still trust me that's enough time for people to forget about it and find something else to do with their 1400 bucks so Sony's got to get this window down to be much much shorter so to summarize there's clearly nothing wrong with Sony making these incredibly high-end impressive Enthusiast phones just like there's nothing wrong with Porsche making their awesome high-end Enthusiast sports cars but Porsha needed that Cayenne to survive and I think Sony is going to need some type of Mass Appeal obvious for the masses type phone that still has the character of all the stuff that makes a Sony phone special I think it'll be a bit smaller version of this I don't think it gets a 4K screen I think it's 1080p it's a much better Auto camera mode because that's what most people just want in a phone it's got to come out a day to two weeks after it's announced and maybe change the name but still keep the design the headphone jack the SIM card tray and micro SD card slot that both pop out without needing any ejector tool yet somehow keep ip68 water resistance definitely keep that keep the taller and more reachable aspect ratio and the square sides and the fast fingerprint reader that's comboed with the power button and the dedicated shutter button definitely keep that the flat screen with no hole punch cut out the stereo front-facing speaker pair all that would be so killer with some fast Android updates until then these will continue to be some of the most underrated phones on the planet but while the rest of the planet even though they exist thanks for watching catch you in the next one peace [Music] thank you,"If Sony every makes a compact version of their flagship phone then shut up and take my money but i guess it won’t happen | Wow, I want a Sony Xperia (i have a 16pro) | Are you related to Justin Brownlee 😂 | “Cayenne” should be a pejorative for when a business has to pander to the masses and make something trash to stay afloat. | I think sony lags behind in terms of support, ecosystem, and software. | I have the legendary SONY XPERIA U (2012) but dead😂😅 | I totally agree with you. | They already have a 5 series | I need a Sony Music phone | The best thing that Sony could do is make a feature packed, genuinely small phone for a decent price tag. I'm talking small. Original iPhone or maybe even Jelly Star small. Something genuinely unexpected that huge swathes of the market would actually love to own."
8om1eJrO2lU,RAZR+ Impressions: Is This What You Wanted?,Motorola's folding phone feels like the beginning of a second generation in 1 (huge) way MKBHD Merch: http://shop.MKBHD.com ...,2023-06-01T18:00:42Z,4299617,113020,6359,"hey what's up MKBHD here and welcome to a Hands-On and first look of a really interesting new folding phone the Moto Razer plus so you know how a lot of these foldable phones have kind of felt like a small bump up from the previous one they're all kind of similar for both the folding and flipping phones well this one feels like a big jump forward for the first time in a while it feels like we're sort of Leaping into the second generation of these flipping phone things that's pretty obvious why so this Razer plus which is the fourth generation of the folding phone for Motorola is going to have a gigantic screen on the outside cover now gigantic is of course a relative term but in the small phone that folds in half and fits in your pocket having a 3.6 in 144hz ped display that goes basically corner to corner all the way around the front and even as pixels around the cameras and the Flash cutouts is pretty dramatically different from what we had before now the rest of the phone is pretty solid tooo right I can't quite call it a flagship since it doesn't really have the highest end available specs but it's pretty close feels like upper you know premium mid-range and the retail price is going to be $9.99 when it launches in a few weeks this summer they've kind of slowly dropped the Retro throwback aesthetic from the first generation of this thing and they've tightened up the edges and modernized the whole thing the huge chin is gone and inside it's a Snapdragon 8 plus gen 1 8 gigs of RAM 256 gigs of storage and a decent size 3800 mAh battery with 30 W charging and 5w wireless charging so yeah not any sort of crazy world beater Flagship specs but still pretty solid I I will note that the 3,800 mAh battery is 1,000 Milah hours greater than the previous gen Razer this thing only had a 2,800 mlia battery so that puts it right in line with the current Z flip the 4 which has a 3700 mamp and then on the inside the main folding display is a 6.9 in 22 by9 1080p P Le display and it's 165hz ltpo display it's not the brightest thing I've ever seen but hey for a folding phone I think it looks really good it's got the whole punch selfie camera at the top the bezels are even thinner and the crease it's not revolutionary it's about as subtle as I've seen in some other folding phones with its redesigned aluminum hinge mechanism it definitely disappears when you're looking at the content and just using the phone but none of that is why this feels like a new generation it feels like a new generation of course because of the giant outside display so let's talk about it this new outside display is really interesting for two reasons one because it's basically what we're also expecting based on the rumors and leaks from what we've seen of Samsung's next flip the flip five it's probably also coming out later this summer but also too because this it does throw a wrench in like how you use a phone like this so like I said this is a 3.6 in 144hz display that basically covers the the entire outside of this phone right up to you get near the hinge where I assume the digitizer is the two primary cameras the 12 megapixel primary and the 13 megapix ultrawide SL macro and the Flash are cutouts with even more pixels around them and in between them and so you can basically do anything you want on this outside screen in its resting state it's just a clock of course but you can change between a bunch of different clock Styles they all have black background so they look pretty seamless on the OLED you also get some basic notifications at the bottom left corner and the ability to manage those notifications when you swipe down from the top you have a whole bunch of quick controls things like brightness and Wi-Fi and a flashlight and whatever media is currently playing but then when you wake it up and unlock with a swipe up from the bottom or a fingerprint unlock you basically get this entire home screen with a wallpaper and a bunch of pages of these things widgets shortcuts Etc now these are limited uh preset Pages they're actually called panels and you can turn them on or off or rearrange them in the settings but they do have a variety of things there's a home panel with the clock and the weather and shortcuts to other panels but then uh of course a calendar panel and a weather panel and a contact panel and you can put them in whatever order you want there's also a Spotify one apparently they've worked with Spotify to create this perfectly optimized one and I do think it looks pretty good but also you can just use whatever app you want on the outside screen there here is a settings page that lets you enable almost any app on your phone to work on the outside screen and control the continuity settings so when you open and close the phone the app stays open which is super useful honestly it sounds pretty great since you can take photos and navigate with Google Maps and pay with gpay and do all kinds of convenient stuff without even opening the phone that's the whole point of the outside screen but it also goes so much further than that you can make and receive phone calls with the phone still closed you can use a whole scientific calculator on the outside screen there's a whole keyboard for typing out messages if you want to send emails or text messages from the outside there's even games of course these are bordering on gimmicky but there's literally games that Motorola built to play on this outside screen like this one where you feed the marble to the end of the maze which is of course the camera cutout like you can watch YouTube videos on this thing if you want to it's going to be a weird Square aspect ratio with all of this but yeah there's basically no limit to what you can do on this outside display it's a super screen it can do whatever you want the screen to do um but hear me out I don't actually know if that's what people want because the more I think about it just just zoom out a little bit with me those uh hot dog style folding phones like the big folding phones those are all productivity monsters you got the screen on the inside and the outside those are for people who want to do as much as possible and fit as big of a screen as they possibly can in their pockets great but then these little flipping phones they've always been smaller and they've always been a little bit more regular I think it's also kind of nice to have a barrier between uh using your phone and not using your phone so if there's just something small and there's a notification you can clear it but I won't get sucked into like scrolling through Tik Tok endlessly or Instagram reels because I will have to open the phone for that but now on this one you can get sucked into Tik toks on the outside screen so is this a good thing I mean for me yeah I mean I I love having tons of functionality on the outside the more the better and they've even built some extra stuff the whole outside screen can be a viewfinder for the camera and there's also this half folded mode that you can use to hold the phone where it feels like an old camcorder from back in the day but the subject can still see themselves there's a lot of cool stuff but yeah I wonder if the customer of a flipping phone like this actually has that like super high on their priority list you know something to think about actually Motorola literally alongside this phone also announced the new Razer so this is the Razer plus we've been talking about with a huge screen for 1,000 bucks but the Razer will come out later this summer and it's also a folding phone but with just the tiny 1 and 1/2 in postage stamp size display on the outside just like from the earliest flipping phones which I don't know just seems to make a lot of sense and the rest of the phone will have just slightly lower end specs like it's a Snapdragon 7 gen one it's a 144 HZ internal display instead of 165 it's 128 gigs of storage instead of 256 it's a vegan leather back instead of Gorilla Glass victus and it's still ip52 water resistant but they didn't tell us the price of this phone so I'm guessing just based on context and knowing that it's probably going to be meaningfully cheaper for this new phone to exist this might be like a $5.99 to 7.99 brand new new folding phone and that's also really interesting plus also because it doesn't have the huge outside screen it has room for a larger battery 4200 milliamp and a larger primary camera 64 megapixel camera so a little lighter on the wallet a little bit more space for other things kind of interesting also speaking of wallets this one's a little bit lighter in your pocket too you can get it at shop. md.com but that's it let me know what you think of the giant outside screen on The Flipping phone is it truly second gen is this where we're going with them all or is this kind of Overkill I'll hang out in the comments for this one I'm really curious what you guys think either way thanks for watching catch you later peace [Music]","I cannot wait to get rid of my Razr plus.   After only 6 months, I have had to replace the screen protector 2 times.  The screen protector keeps coming off at the fold, after about 500 folds.   AND, apparently, ALL folding phones have this problem! | What I want is an ultra-small phone the size of hold of this flip phone, with just the outside screen. The tech is clearly there. Just make it! | Waiting for Sony 10VI Review buddy. I hope you drop it soon. | iPhone will have a flip phone three years from now . | I wonder how the hindges are | 2:00 this right here is the only reasons flip phones aren’t for me right now. I can’t easily flip it open with one hand like we could back in the day. | MOTOROLA IS THE MOST INNOVATIVE PHONE COMPANY, HANDS DOWN!!! | Japanese phone reviewers are better and more reliable | Hi I got this phone thanks to an insurance replacement. My Motorola keep our 2024 edition died on me and wouldn't turn on anymore so insurance company gives me a new one. I was super surprised to find not my phone in the package but this phone in the package that's just amazing. Wasn't expecting this this phone. Yeah there are things that I like about it and then I don't like about it like how it doesn't have a memory card anymore. Yes I know you can get on the go support memory card readers that you can plug into it but it's not the same as having a built-in memory card. Yes I know 256 is a lot of pictures and video so we'll see what this phone if I can handle taking pictures and videos. And I'm very nervous with it the way you fold it I think it's going to break but no it's not it's designed to fold that way I just don't really want to keep folding it that way. I'll get used to it overtime though it's just a matter of do I like it or don't I | So Motorola just took the razr 2023+ and just renamed it razr 2024 because now the 2024 razr+ has a even bigger outside screen hopefully the 2025 razr has the big 2024+ outside screen because I'm with cricket so I get discounts with the none + models"
03OZsmDV56k,iPad Killer or Clone?,OnePlus Pad MKBHD Merch: http://shop.MKBHD.com OnePlus Pad: https://geni.us/HWpx Tech I'm using right now: ...,2023-05-26T20:50:13Z,3875821,98643,4476,so OnePlus made a tablet and I made a quick short explaining it and immediately there are a bunch of comments like oh please this is worth a full video please make a full video on this please elaborate on this so now that's what I'm doing so I really get to explain what they've done see tablets haven't really changed much over the past couple years feels like we've kind of settled if you will into this sort of hierarchy where especially in the US iPads are so popular that it's basically just iPads and everything else and I've even had conversations recently with some friends about this which is just like they straight up won't switch from the iPad like no matter how good of a competitor comes up it can be amazing Hardware it can be the best screen the best battery in the world it's an amazing tablet but it still wouldn't be an iPad which is the iMessage and the FaceTime and all the things that plug into the ecosystem of iPad and apple world so making an Android tablet that can actually take users from the iPad is clearly an uphill battle but hey if you're gonna try you might as well have some strategy to it and so OnePlus has three so strategy number one copying the iPad so look just to be clear I understand there's only so many ways to make a rectangular computer there's only so many ways to make a tablet uh and I actually don't mind when products copy each other as long as they copy the good stuff that being said yeah they've ripped some stuff straight from the iPad now it does have its own unique Hardware aesthetic you got to give them that it's a different shape and a different color and of course it's a different layout with a bunch of OnePlus and Android features that really suggest more holding it in landscape unlike the iPads which feel a bit more interchangeable but they weren't shy about some things like this pencil this is the apple pencil and this is the new OnePlus pencil same shape same size same pressure sensitive tip which is nice same single flat side which prevents it from Rolling away on a table which is smart but then same slapping onto the side of a tablet with magnets and charging it by inductive wireless charging so you don't lose it it's convenient it even has the same little animation to show you when you've paired it and how much battery percentage you have there are probably other ways to do this but you know the result is just a very familiar experience with a nice finely controlled pressure sensitive pointing device for navigating around and swiping and even typing and of course all the drawing and note taking you possibly want they've also made a magnetic keyboard accessory with a trackpad that can connects to the tablet with magnets and these pins and turns it into a whole lappable Android 11 inch laptop alternative it might not completely float the tablet above the keyboard like the heavier less lappable one from Apple but it does use basically the exact same cursor mechanism as the iPad where you can swipe around with this dark circle and then it snaps onto different touch targets As you move near them again a pretty great thing to copy it's got quad speakers in the same four spots as the iPad Pro it's even got this Ultra wide camera at the front that has a software feature that can move around as you walk around and keep you in the center of the frame it's not called Center Stage though it's called Limelight the point is there's a ton of stuff here where if you're going to take people away from the iPad you gotta at least make them feel at home so then strategy number two undercutting the iPad this one's pretty simple the iPad line is already pretty expensive so probably the most compelling thing you can do to get someone to consider an alternative is to be cheaper than the iPad so iPad Air I think that's a pretty good comp iPad Air starts right now with the newest one at 5.99 and that's the 64 gig version this tablet as we mentioned pretty fairly priced 479 and that's 128 gig so you can see it's a pretty good start but you have to be careful because in order to get to that price you have to trim just the right set of things that people hopefully don't notice too much so this tablet is running a mediatek demensity 9000 chip which benchmarks similar to the Snapdragon 8 plus gen 1 which is about 50 beneath the more expensive Flagship Snapdragon 8 gen 2. honestly most of the time not noticeable but if you are going to ask it some more demanding things especially like gaming then you will feel that this is not the highest end chip there is also no fingerprint reader which is fine but there's also no extra infrared or depth sensors it's just straight up facial recognition with the standard RGB selfie camera and for some reason my face has to be really close to it to unlock it's just picky enough to get slightly annoying sometimes and then this display doesn't quite get as bright it maxes out at 500 nits so it limits your outdoor usability for sure and then this keyboard case which is optional it's actually noticeably cheaper than Apples too it's actually 149 so it's literally half the price of the magic keyboard but also it's not back lit it doesn't float the tablet or anything it's also less premium feeling material so it's more in line with the smart folio case which is still 179 but really the most interesting strategy strategy number three is one-upping the iPad there are some things they've done with this tablet that are objectively better than any iPad okay so here we go first of all this is an 11.5 inch display with a unique slightly tall seven by five aspect ratio and slightly thinner bezels on the iPad but you know what's straight up better than any iPad it's 144 Hertz refresh rate granted that's only slightly higher than 120 hertz iPad Pro but for 479 I mean you're more in line with the 60 hertz iPad Air and I'm a sucker for a high refresh rate display and I do notice the difference in a few key places like scrolling around browsing in Chrome and drawing with the pen but more on that in a second the ultra wide front facing camera is on the landscape bezel that's also better than almost every iPad except for the newest cheap one so anytime you're on a video call you actually sit in the middle of the frame not kind of awkwardly off to one side it also is an objectively better battery than any iPad this is a 9 500 10 milliamp hour battery that's iPad Pro sized and combined with the chip has Rock Solid battery life and very good standby time and it charges much faster than any iPad it's got 67 watt supervook charging so most of the tablet using world is going to be used to the iPad's kind of slow 30 watts of charging this one can charge from zero to 100 in an hour and a half with the charger that's included in the box and then there's also this whole special features section in the settings where they've tucked these nice clever little enhancements mostly to do with the multitasking experience so I'm not even going to remind you of the disaster that is stage manager on the iPad that's still kind of rough but on the OnePlus pad you can do things like drag two fingers down from the middle of the screen to slice your app in half and initiate split screen multitasking with apps that support it and then there's three different window sizes that it supports and you can switch those around there's also a smart side bar that kind of slides out from the top right where it's this hidden dock so you can put your favorite apps in there or some quick shortcuts to grab whatever you want or just open up the list of all your apps again so lots of good stuff in here right even they've even got some little ecosystem stuff going on since OnePlus makes phones you can do data sharing with another OnePlus phone super easily there's a lot but this is still an Android tablet which means a lot of things it means of course that there is no FaceTime iMessage all the ecosystem stuff that comes that Apple people like obviously but that also means the app situation is still not what you want it to be like when I say apps that support it with multitasking that's a pretty small list like there's just very few good well-optimized Android tablet apps even today in 2023 it also means that the 144hz capable display is rarely actually uh refreshing at 144hz it's often at 120 hertz or even 60 hertz depending on the app support again uh and that sort of means you only really get the extra stuff when you're scrolling around the UI or web browsing or in the settings app basically and not while gaming it also means the cameras are meh so you see the the camera is sort of in this unique layout in the middle it's a 13 megapixel camera on the back but the photos it takes are pretty mid not that a tablet is like some photography machine it's mostly for video calls but even this is pretty grainy it has this like splotching even in a well-lit environment not great and then for the arguably even more important selfie camera it's it's mostly for video calls and so it should look pretty decent this is perfect lighting and even in these dark shadows you can see some weird noise artifacts and splotching and and this over here it it's 1080P and it's it's fine it's probably fine but in Limelight mode when it's doing the ultra wide and hunting around it looks worse than this too and it also means that Android 14 is on the horizon so that will probably improve a lot of the multitasking stuff we just saw but this one's going to launch with Android 13. so if you get one it'll have Android 13 and never buy a product based on potential future software updates so as of right now it's an Android 13 tablet so OnePlus has made a good tablet for a good price I think a lot of people consider this a bargain f479 for the 128 gigs but because of this data tablets it feels like they're up against some impossible task like this is the same thing that happened to Samsung's Ultra tablet remember the video I made on the ultra the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra tried something super super high end and honestly in the hardware and design department they really beat the iPad in a lot of ways they made an incredible piece but same question where is it now I think the same place as this some people are going to buy it and they're going to be pretty happy with it and those people knew exactly what they were getting into and it's a tough task taking tablet buyers from the iPad thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace [Music] foreign [Music],"Looks  cool don't buy CCP Spyware!

The interior features are insane. | Ugly car?  Strongly disagree. | Elon got all this but can't be happy unless poor people suffer smh | This video made him so likable until the other video came out of him doing 100 in a school zone or something to that nature. Also that app of wall paper was cheesy too | Really Nice car | Definitely not a car to own after the 4 year/50,000 mile warranty.  Most luxury cars are business cars.  One reason they depreciate so fast.  Wealthy always buys new.  2nd owner receives a deal but parts/service still for a $100,000 plus vehicle. | Pls review Mahindra BE6 and xev 9e, which are also really high-tech.

J1oEWiUsKgU,I Tried a Secret Google Project!,An exclusive first look and footage of Google Project Starline! The Studio reactions: https://youtu.be/J0urPcc1GWs MKBHD Merch: ...,2023-05-18T03:05:40Z,3086590,139026,7450,oh okay this might be the most impressive Tech demo I've ever seen it's also one of the hardest to explain on video but I'm going to try so there's a thing called Google project Starline you might have heard of it might have not but Google has showed a few video examples of this live super immersive like 3D video calling Booth where you sit down in front of it and on the other side someone else sits down and through the power of the internet it looks like an extremely realistic version of them is actually in front of you it's not just a normal video call but it's not a hologram it's just it's something different either way we got the first look at it at Google IO a couple of years ago they showed this clip in the keynote and nobody got to record it nobody even got to try it but now they're back with a better looking more compact more simplified version and I got to try it and record it now just as a warning this first clip it doesn't actually do it justice because the effect does not translate very well on camera we'll get to that but I was lucky enough to get my first reaction to this my actual first time seeing it on camera all right let's see project Starline start soon oh wow hey how are you great okay good to see you welcome to Starline thank you this is right yeah it's a lot more yeah you and I just saw each other right outside but we're in two different rooms and we want to make it feel like we left that space and we came back together in a virtual space it feels like we're completely in the same spot it really looks like I can actually uh it looks like you could drop something on this table right here yeah yeah I've got a little apple over here so let me show you that too so you know you and I are in the same room do you want me to pass this over into your space this looks like you can do it we're meant to feel like this room is just one room instead of two separate locations could be anywhere in the world so this is uh something we think is the glimpse of what communication could look like in the next few years that's incredible okay yeah I gotta learn more about this okay so what exactly is happening here so I'm sitting in front of the new Starline Booth is what I'd call it now the first Starline they ever made was much bigger they had these like full room setups essentially with a bench and computers the display but also a bunch of cameras and depth sensors placed around you this new one feels actually much more refined it looks much simpler and it kind of feels like a reasonable product It's a 65 in display on a stand with a smaller barrier over the bottom bezel and then there are actually some lights on the back that point at the wall behind the display that serve as a key light for me the person on the call and then there are no more depth sensors it's just a tidy array of color cameras and microphones and speakers so that's at the top the left and the right and they use AI to create a depth map of me and the room I'm in and then the magic of this is twofold It's the display and the Computing happening so the display the part giving you the actually impressive immersive 3D depth effect but then also all the Computing happening to turn me the person on the video call and the person on the other side into this realistic 3D model just with the camera information that you can actually look around with headtracking now clearly this doesn't translate well on camera which is why Google has understandably been super protective over anyone trying it even or or getting any photos or videos of it because it just won't look right but I was able to convince Google to let me try something you see basically once you first sit down in the Starline Booth this system has to identify where your face is and then you can move around and look at stuff with head and body tracking and of course that's not going to work if you just put a camera in there but if you do show it a face and a camera at the same time like say maybe a cardboard face where you can stick a camera lens somehow through that cardboard face then it would track and you could eh see what I'm talking about check this out so what what you're seeing right now is as if you were on a video call with me in the newest version of Google Starline this is the first time anyone outside of Google has seen this sort of visualization which is super cool so it looks pretty reasonable right now right I can hold up an object you can see the colors and the shapes and the lighting and textures on it and this is all information compiled from the array of cameras around me and the depth information comes from these regular cameras and that's all quite cool but as you start moving around that's when it starts getting a little more interesting because I can hold things out and you start to create this powerlax effect with the head tracking where you can start to literally look around and inspect the object and look underneath things as if you're literally in the room with me it's super convincing to the actual eye when you see it on this screen uh even the background behind me is not real it's being composited in but I'm casting a shadow on it and that's being rendered in real time too it's a lot we can even flip a s to show a sort of a topographical map of specifically the depth information coming from these cameras so again no depth cameras specifically being used here but the array of color cameras has all this depth information being mapped and that's what all the information from the color cameras is being sort of projected onto there's a lot of processing happening here so it all comes together to form this really impressive real time I mean I use the word immersion very lightly usually but I I want to stress that it's very immersive when you actually get to use it so hopefully this helps you visualize so that is pretty cool but even that doesn't translate perfectly because the feeling of depth actually comes from the distance between your eyes so a camera lens is one eye but if you've ever tried to catch something with one eye closed you know that humans perceive depth by the difference between what you see with your left eye and what you see with your right eye your stitches them together and figures out depth that way so even that demo doesn't quite get the full realisticness of what I saw on camera but it's pretty close the light fueld display in Project Starline is literally showing a different image to my left eye and to my right eye so taking advantage of that biological fact and then letting me actually compute depth on the Fly while doing all the head tracking in real time it's actually kind of crazy like if you've ever seen 3D glasses you know how when you go see a 3D movie like one of the eyes is blue one of the eyes is red that it's literally because your left eye will see something mapped for that and your right eye will see something mapped for that and that's how it creates the depth effect but this is way better than a 3D movie it's so much smoother and the head tracking and everything that goes with it and it's ah it's so good but then the craziest part that the the most impressive part is the Computing that's happening which is rendering the people using Starline in real time into these 3D models so this is not like the metaverse thing where the VR headset tracks face movement and then you you can have a eye contact face-to-face conversation with someone's Cartoon Avatar but no no no this is this is taking the actual Imaging the lighting the the way you actually look what you're actually wearing and rendering that out in real time in 3D space and making it look like I'm talking to them through a window it's kind of amazing the eye contact is so onetoone re looking and it really just comes from the fact that I'm sitting here looking forward and the person on the other side is also looking forward and so we're actually looking into each other's eyes so anyway yeah it it is the point is it's super realistic I promise you when I was when I first did my demo the first time I ever saw it even knowing that it's 3D I still felt like I could reach out and like high five him or like fist bump him he held that Apple out actually and to my eyes it looked like he could just drop the apple he was holding right on the table in front of me which of course meant that I look stupid from this angle cuz I'm just reaching out at nothing but we got a bunch of reactions from some other Studio team members who got to join me for this demo I'll link a video that has some of their reactions below you should definitely check that out so it was really only the like slight glitching a little bit of edges and fading and stuff like that that kept out of uncanny valley territory like obviously the eye contact is one thing and the 3d effect even it had spatial audio so if I leaned over here it would sound like more audio came into one of your ears and that was responsive but you know things like in between the fingers or like the edges of certain Fabrics or my hair especially some of that stuff could kind of break it a little bit and you could tell but honestly I wasn't thinking about that at all so you might be thinking kind of the same thing I was after I finished this demo which is okay this is super cool but what is this for like what is this sort of a tech demo actually useful for and the answer is we don't really know yet so at this point in time Google has worked with a few companies Salesforce Wei workor and T-Mobile are some examples who are literally using some of these booths for meetings basically I guess theoretically that's better than a zoom call although it still has its limitations like the face tracking can only work with one person at a time which means only one person can be in the booth at a time to get their realistic depth effect so adding another person doesn't work I think the question will be closer to being answered when the tech gets even better like we it's already gone from the size of a room to the size of like an easel it could just be the size of a TV with a backpack on it but this will get more realistic cheaper simpler and just better but you know here's the thing I actually don't know that regular people will actually want this like hear me out if I know anything about bleeding edge Tech which I've tried a lot of it's that regular people the masses are not very fast to pay extra for higher Fidelity like better quality so the the cut off for acceptable quality quality is surprisingly low for the masses like think about it audio quality I don't know streaming on Spotify over Bluetooth seems to be good enough for most people airpods are the most popular headphones in the world you think about cameras and how smartphone cameras are basically good enough for 99% of the taking pictures of your kids you know so convenience is King that like that's why right now FaceTime and zoom are it's just a square of a flat Low reses video feed on a screen that's fine it's fine for most people when you turn it all the way up to project Starline which is like this incredibly realistic like you can see micro expressions and textures and feel like you're in the room with the person that's over on one side here and FaceTime and Zoomer on the other side here and this is where the masses live and this is like businesses you know getting a booth so they don't have to fly people out for lots of meetings overseas but it's still too expensive and too difficult to get to for most people but that's just for now that's just for this version now I am really looking forward to keeping an eye on how this Tech evolves from Google and even from others who are working on this whole 3D light field display technology stuff we've actually seen some interesting stuff before I actually tried an Asus laptop not too many weeks ago that does the same thing it renders a unique image for each of your eyes and does head tracking for an incredibly realistic 3d effect but of course for that you have to look at a certain file that was built in a certain model and work with certain software where this was like rendering real people and just having a conversation it's crazy it's crazy I'm going to thank you for Google for letting us see this and I'm going to hopefully be able to try future versions when they get finished cuz this is wild let me know what you guys think thanks for watching catch you in the next one peace [Music],"Checkouts will be ran like this | Maybe in retail. Mostly will stay unused. | Another case of star trek predicting the future :) love it | I tried this today and it was UNREAL | Without any glasses, how does it show different image to the left vs right eye? | Stuff you see in the blade runner is becoming more of a reality .. | How is the 3d effect made? 2 separat images for each eye.. two glasses in the screen with a certain texture and moving? (Eye tracked) | What bandwith do we need to use IT? | I think I saw this in mission impossible | So finally we are getting a fully working giant 4k Nintendo 3DS Emulator ? 😮
Google, please add another touch screen roght on the table 😮"
cTxJ5oLuxkM,The Flagship vs Midrange Debate: Galaxy A54 Review!,How close is a midrange phone actually to a flagship in 2023? MKBHD Merch: http://shop.MKBHD.com Samsung Galaxy A54: ...,2023-05-01T01:03:55Z,4648275,134973,6476,"so here's the thing I used to be able to say cheap phones are getting good and good phones are getting cheap because it was true for a while there but then we started getting these more and more expensive Flagship phones they broke through this thousand price barrier we've got super expensive phones now so I can no longer stand by the second half of that statement but the first half still pretty compelling and so this is the Samsung Galaxy a54 which just came out pretty recently and represents roughly the middle list of Samsung's lineup where they've got phones at every price from like 160 bucks all the way up to nearly $2,000 and this one actually has a great case to be the best value in the entire lineup I didn't expect to say that but I'm saying it now because I've been using this phone for the past two weeks and it actually delivers very well on a lot of the premium smartphone experience but at literally a third of the price of the flagship from the same company literally this phone MSRP is like 400 450 bucks right now if you sign the right contract in the US you could basically get it for free and the flagship that I've been daily driving for like the first half of this year so far is the s23 ultra which retails for $1,200 still so what I wanted to find out and show you in this video is how close does this a54 get to this s23 Ultra or any of these Mega flagships that are like it because it's definitely not a third of the functionality so I'm breaking this down into five categories because these are my Five Pillars of a great smartphone build quality display performance camera and battery so I've said before if a smartphone can nail all five of these things then it's a good phone period And as a product goes down in price then you naturally expect it to start to make some sacrifices in some of these areas so right from the top with build quality it gets interesting because Samsung kind of adopted this thing where they use essentially the same design language across their entire lineup to keep it consistent and recognizable but that also basically means that this $1,200 phone does not look dramatically different from this $400 to $450 phone Samsung is one of these companies that only does the satin SL matat finish on the backs of their most premium phones and so the squared off rails on the s23 ultra are a polish aluminum for contrast the a54 on the other hand is the other way around it's glossy glass on the back and it's a more Satin finish on the aluminum rails and I kind of like that too at the end of the day though they're literally both glass and aluminum and so really it comes down to two main differences between the two one is the size they only come in these sizes and so this a54 is definitively smaller and lighter than the ultra and two it's flat and that's totally fine where the ultra does have this little bit of a curve on the sides of the display but to be honest yeah build quality is very close here it is IP67 versus ip68 which by definition is almost the same thing and the a54 puts the SIM card slot plus expandable storage at the top where the flagship just has a SIM card tray at the bottom with no expandable storage if I can safely assume that both Gorilla Glass 5 and Gorilla Glass victus 2 both scratch out a level six with deeper grooves out of level seven I feel pretty comfortable saying that the a54 is 90% of the build quality of the flagship which is a really good start so then there's the displays now this is Samsung we're talking about here so they definitely go the ex ex Mile with the flagship display no question about that it is ridiculously good incredibly bright super sharp responsive adaptive and efficient I mean every number on paper is pretty close to maxed out from the 1440p resolution to the 1750 nits of brightness from an AMOLED panel 120 HZ Max refresh rate but variable down to 1 HZ with ltpo I mean it's pretty awesome so the a54 display is a step down on paper sure and when you use it you realize that they've cut out like the extra bells and whistles the over-the-top stuff that are maybe a little more for The Fringe situations but still keep the screen to a pretty premium level for 99% of use cases so like I said this only comes in one size so it's a little smaller than the flagship but that's also probably a good thing for some people cuz phones are huge so this is a 6.4 in 1080P flat ammo lead this is still over 400 pixels per inch so even though it can't do Quad HD it's still going to be pretty great for for most people that aren't pixel peeping like I am and it's still plenty bright I mean I'm looking at this thing it gets up to a th000 nits and regularly goes outdoors and looks totally fine like in the dashboard of my car and out in the sun no problems so in that way it's pretty close but you can also see the bezels all the way around are a little bit thicker this is one of those things that tends to get like pointed out in YouTube comments more than by people actually buying the phone but yeah it's true it does have slightly bigger bezels and a bigger chin it's not completely corner to corner and then while the s23 ultra has the ltpo that can adapt all the way from 120 HZ down to 1 HZ when it's not moving this a54 display can adapt from 120 HZ down to 60 HZ and basically switch back and forth so not quite as adaptive and efficient but better than nothing and it goes pretty blue off axis more than some of the more premium Samsung panels already do and also that hole punch cutout as I pointed out before is not quite the little perfect black circle but it does have this little tiny metal ring that can be slightly distracting when the Sun hits it at just the right angle it's a small thing but I got to mention it but yeah they still give you every single setting in here as the more expensive phone to dial in the displays colors and match what you're looking for so overall I'm willing to say the a54 has 80% of the display of the flagship it's obviously not going to match it on paper and in the most bleeding edge extreme situations like direct outdoor sunlight and things like that then you can see the difference but honestly most of the time when you're just using the phone especially indoors they look very similar which is pretty amazing just with slightly thicker bezels so then there's performance now this is where you start to get a little bit of a wider Gap here so you've already heard about the flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 8 gigs of RAM one tab of storage all that good stuff uh this is working with a lesser chip set here so it's it's just not going to be as good so the a54 is powered by an exos 1380 chip which benchmarks about 50 to 80% lower than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 in CPU it's it's a very comfortably mid-range chip I'll put it that way for context it's putting up similar geek bench scores to the a12 bionic which was in the iPhone 10s in 2018 so pair this with 6 gigs of RAM and you've got a phone that you know can handle everyday tasks but it isn't blowing anything out the water in terms of performance and the specs are only part of performance like when I when I say performance as a pillar obviously you want it to be able to open apps very quickly and be smooth and reliable so for normal daily things like checking email or social media scrolling or just subscribing to this YouTube channel like it it feels just like the flagships because it's fine and it's also 120 HZ and it's smooth that stuff doesn't require a super high-end chip now sure there are a few dropped frames here and there and it does feel a little bit different and if you gave me these two phones and didn't tell me which was which sooner or later I could tell you which one was a lower-end chip but it would require me starting to push you know some higher end stuff starting to multitask starting to flip between a couple heavier apps at once opening and closing a few things when you get to like navigating while streaming music over bluetooth you know while reading something in a web browser on a big website stuff like that then the difference is actually really quite noticeable and then the s23 line all has these like Lightning Fast ultrasonic fingerprint sensors while the a54 does have an optical sensor which is just a bit slower and has to shine a light for a second instead of the ultrasonic ones which are more versatile you can also argue that built-in storage is going to be faster than expandable although some people just don't care like they just want expandable storage in which case that's actually a benefit for the a54 but yeah it's it's pretty clear that the performance difference between Flagship chipset and mid-ranger is pretty big it's noticeable it's a it's a feel thing it's a smoothness thing if you haven't used a more expensive phone you might not even notice but that's what it comes down to and especially with the higher end tasks these phones are running the same software one UI 5.1 but just one executes the same stuff a little more reliably and smoother so I'm going to give a54 60% of the performance of the flagship not bad so now cameras cameras cameras cameras we got all kinds of cameras typically cameras are what separate the good phones from the great phones and that's still true so you look at the back of the a54 and it looks just like all the rest of the s23 series uh obviously not as many cameras as the ultra but when you actually hear that this is the 50 megapixel main camera and this is the 12 megapixel ultrawide and this is a 5 megapixel macro now you're starting to see where they saved money like in what world do you want a macro camera over a zoom camera this is the obvious version of like making it look like the more expensive phone but saving some money not putting a zoom but still having something there so now the actual photo and video taking experience is the same as the more expensive phones literally it's the same app the same UI the same features and buttons so that's fine we can all say what we want about Samsung's layouts but you know they work they're pretty straightforward and then the photos you get in good lighting they seem perfectly fine like if you don't compare it to something super expensive these are all super passable sharp detailed normal looking photos maybe a little bit blue with the white balance a little bit Overexposed but honestly short of the pixel 6A this is a about as good as you'd expect from a $450 phone but of course like I said my goal is to compare it to the super expensive big brother so when you do that highlights a little more some of the flaws of the a54 main camera which really is just that it tends to overexpose and take unnecessarily bright shots quite often and the white balance is a little inconsistent but it's funny this always this angle always feels weird because most people buying this phone have never they have they haven't come from a $1,200 phone they don't know what a $1,200 phone's capabilities would be so it's like comparing a Toyota Corolla to a Supra sure they come from the same company but like people buying the Corolla weren't cross shopping with a Supra and they weren't even thinking about getting the performance of a Supra so just me putting them side by side helps highlight the differences uh but yeah this camera's set as fine I think sometimes I boil the camera all the way down to like yeah this one's just fine but I really mean it it's fine like when you zoom in yeah you lose sharpness because you went with a macro over a telephoto so it doesn't come close to touching the zoom performance of the more expensive phone past about 45x the a54 also can't do 8K video or even 4K 60 like the flagship can but it can do everything else just fine and the ultra wide is pretty soft as expected especially in lower light but it happens to actually be a tiny bit wider than the flagships ultrawide so it's got that going for it you know between the missing telephotos and the Lesser compute power this one can go in a bunch of different directions but I'll say the a54 is 70% of the camera for most normal photos of the flagship which is pretty good but then last but not least battery this one's pretty simple 5,000 Mah hours 5,000 milliamp hours and so it turns out the usable daily battery life of these two phones is pretty similar but the thing about the chips though is the the Snapdragon AG Gen 2 which is in a lot of the higher end newer phones now is it's really good it's it's also it's both more powerful and more efficient uh than the exos so basically this flagship phone is capable of way more it's it's capable of a much higher Peak output and so you can actually Spike the usage a lot and like run down the battery pretty hard if you wanted to but then it's also more efficient so for you know combining it with this ltpo display just using it everyday regular scrolling social media email hanging out you know this is It's sipping battery it's actually going slower through battery than the a54 so the a54 is more of a constant drain it doesn't Spike as high but it doesn't have as good standby time so the the curve of the flagship phone might look more like spiky but the a54 looks more like an even descent if that makes sense now you also do not get wireless charging with the a54 just despite the glass back that's one of those features that you sometimes see in phones at this price but it's definitely a common emission and the max charging rate is 25 watts which is straight up slow in 2023 but it's F it's serviceable there are all kinds of phones offering blazing fast like 50 80 100 plus watt charging even at this lower price point so even if the battery isn't amazing you could at least top up quickly if you had that but that's not here either so it'll take about an hour to charge from 0 to 100 totally average average but overall it's it's not a substantial weakness especially versus the flagship from the same company which only does 45 Watts so a54 battery experience is is like 90% of the flagship so if you total up all of my assessments uh and average them out over 500 points you get 78% of the flagship for a third of the price which that seems like it's pretty clear that it's a pretty good deal now there's also of course lots of little things that didn't quite fit into those pillars like the slightly better haptics of the flagship for example you might be really into that or the bigger speakers that come from having a bigger phone that do sound better uh also there's a stylus in the big one uh also if you want decks you'd have to pay up because the a54 doesn't have that funny thing is they both have the exact same unboxing experience which is just a phone no charger but yeah these mid-rangers today master F mitigate the law of diminishing returns matching the flagships Finesse for a fraction of the funds thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace Demand on you just be","Thankh you i kust got the a54 and omg i am luving it, | Review the A55 it's good | I mostly see mid-range phone reviews  from non-mkbhd youtuber, and watching this video made understand the diffrerrence, no one has made me understand what a mid-range actually is the way this video explained everything.  reviewers  just say ""it's good value for your money, if you cant afford flagships"". mkbhd showed the value, what you missing and getting with this phone | 😅 | The best phone to buy for flagships is the last gen flagship used at a good price and maybe get a new battery for it. | Where can I find that walpaper? | I hate that buying IPS phones is becoming harder even below 200$ | As a techie, I love these comparison videos. | My mother has this phone and often makes me fix stuff for her, i can only imagine the pain of someone like MKB going trough 2 weeks of dayling this phone... | Super video"

YouTube that's almost ridiculous and the question always comes up in the back around well Marquez when are you going to make design your own product right so 2 years of materials work and design work and basically a lifetime of inspiration later I'm actually holding the thing this is the first one it's called m251 why is it called 251 you might be asking good question I'm glad you asked so this is still a collaboration after all I could have all the ideas for shoe stuff in the world but I still need someone to build the shoe so Adams is the company that's come through for me on this one they've had their model o and then model1 they've been hailed some of the most comfortable shoes of all time and I agree but this would be something completely new for both of us the length of my first ever YouTube video on Tech yeah that one was 2 minutes and 51 seconds long a new beginning and that's also sort of a new beginning [Music] now if you know me you already knew I like shoes but I'm not suddenly a shoe designer out of nowhere so the idea was that I would take all sorts of bits and pieces from different shoes that I like shoes that I've worn shoes that I've seen and try to combine as many of that in one place as I possibly can so the lightweightness of nmds uh the silhouette of Jordan WS things like the the sole and the elastic laces of Adam shoes and a little bits and details and Tiny things from Blazers and off-white collabs and so we went through a lot of prototypes and a lot of things like that to sort of accomplish that put them all in one place so the process was really fun actually and we went through as many combinations as possible and went through a ton of different ideas and Designs we're trying to figure out what was possible and what wasn't in is shoe we have a lot of older prototypes that we didn't go with that had things like fitment issues and support issues and material issues and we went through and basically Adam could tell me like this will be possible versus this won't be possible this will be more expensive versus this won't be more expensive and so all the different parts of the shoe had to come together from our combination of expertise and my taste it was one of the most fun processes I've ever gone through and then the other part of that was I literally got to wear them around and start testing them so once we got working prototypes like this one I wore for weeks literally started showing up in videos by accident just because I was just daily driving these things every day testing my own creation so we went through dozens of samples over 2 plus years I mean this is a long process we're like we have an idea for a YouTube video and we can make that in a couple of days this is something that's been in our heads and in the background for a long time but we finally have come to a final version and I really really like it and I'm now excited to like get you guys to actually wear it and try it yourselves so now I can't review my own product actually I'm really excited for all shoe reviewers to be able to do that but what I can do is tell you all about it so the silhouette it's pretty simple right it's not fully high top but obviously not a low top either it's a really comfortable daily mid and this upper is a combo of synthetic leather and then we actually have a recycled mesh fabric that's a nice balance between breathable and supportive and it took a lot of samples to get that right and if you're curious development wise this soulle was actually the hardest part so I'm on my feet all day my job as a video producer in this studio does involve a lot of walking it's a lot of moving around and crouching and kneeling and all kinds of stuff like that so Comfort is a high priority so this outsole has to be supportive enough to actually function and hold up the shoes so it doesn't collapse but also still be soft enough through the midsole that it's really comfortable and this bottom sole is proprietary it's all very I don't know came together super nicely uh we also did something a little bit interesting just if you see the the the shape along the side so this is a little bit structural it's a little Heel To Toe drop so if you're used to wearing shoes that are a lot flatter like J's or Converses you will notice and feel a bit of a difference with this shape and it's really good there's a copper lining in here that's naturally antimicrobial which does help prevent odors which is awesome uh my signature and size stamp is on the tongue we've got this loop on the back too which is actually functional and that's where we put the atams logo which is the top one here and the MKBHD parallel in the same style and of course the elastic laces underrated a lot of people don't know about these but you can sort of just treat them like normal laces maybe time a little looser or tighter and then they Flex a little bit to support your foot as you're moving around uh there's little details like the New York City Tag the 251 is stitched even um taking it apart even the sole is uh custom designed and it kind of Cups your foot a little bit and is soft as well all of this stuff is awesome I really couldn't be happier with how these turned out now if you get these you have to promise me one thing wear your kicks I I am such like there's this whole culture of like you get shoes and then you have to like baby them and take really good care of them for proper resale value no no no you got to actually daily these and like wear them out and put them to work I still get I still get roasted on Instagram for like crouching down in a picture and then the toe boxes crease and then all the comments are like what are you doing you're ruining your shoes no wear your kicks crease your kicks wear them in all four seasons I'm going to be daing these things we put a lot of work into the engineering of them to be able to do that so winter spring summer fall snow mud uh you'll be able to see mine on social media getting dirty as I wear them a ton we love that so I'm going to make sure these are available as worldwide as we possibly can and maybe you'll even see me pop up in a retail shop once in a while to help just get the word out about them and I hope if you get them that you wear them to so this 251 is an exciting New Beginning also I've been waiting a long time to do this [Music],"It's getting harder and harder to find popular YTers not attempting to fleece their fans with jacked up prices on merch. | Are they good basketball shoes | If your feet are narrow and the shoes aren't defective, then it might be worth buying them. In my case, my feet aren't parallel to the ground but 'roll' like wheels on a drift car, which I assume is due to a defect. Also, the shoes are narrow where the balls of the feet are. | So bro is the Sneakers available in SouthAfrica  or not? | I want a strap version bro pls! An we need that clear sole  too | I need my money back for buying this cheap ssssssssssshit | Walmart ass shoe bruh....200$ for trash | Theses shoes are ass | I am a shoes, connoisseur kind of guy and I would love to test out your new shoes please let’s hook up and do a review | Bro you’re a King of intro"
-BwUyTrU9fo,"I Spent $40,000 to Unbox a Sealed Original iPhone!",This original sealed iPhone cost $40000. I regret (almost) nothing Original iPhone vs modern iPhone: https://youtu.be/zIjngBAxTr4 ...,2023-04-20T22:02:23Z,9703260,356323,14693,"all right in the collector world of Classics usually old pieces of tech aren't really all that interesting like who wants to buy an iPhone 6 right now the number one most sought after piece of tech in The Collector world is the factory sealed unopened original iPhone now fun fact back when we went to go make that um reviewing every single iPhone video we did have to go back and find and buy a working version of every single iPhone ever made and the further back you go the harder it is to find a working version and we eventually did find a couple like these three original used but still working iPhones from 2007 maybe it's cuz they're 16 years old they are really beat up but the fact that they're still working is kind of a miracle finding one that is original still sealed never been opened never even been touched by human hands or seen by human eyes is uh extremely rare it's so rare that I've actually seen many people get scammed by this an unopened iPhone is so rare and valuable that people will actually reeal a used original iPhone and sell it online as an original and man YouTubers have fallen victim to this spending thousands of dollars to try to get their hands on what they thought was going to be an untouched iPhone it's just crazy that people go out scamming like this but hey the difference in value between just any old original iPhone and a new sealed untouched iPhone is gigantic and it's well worth the price of the cellophane and the heat gun and the effort required to make an old iPhone seem new only about 6 million first gen iPhones were ever sold and so of course the number of unopened ones will only ever go down from here and it's sort of this weird game of trying to figure out when their value has peaked and looking at the numbers it actually feels like it has peaked so one actually sold at an auction in February this year for over $60,000 which was a record and the highest we've ever seen then another one appeared at an auction in March a month later that one went for $555,000 then there was one with this lucky you sticker even more rare they probably thought they were going to get the most money for it but it actually went up at an auction a few weeks ago in Chicago and somebody scooped it for only $40,000 I guess they got a bit of a discount because that person was me and this is the package it came in uh because that auction house was not messing around it was actually kind of surreal winning this auction just for the record it's not like a normal auction site like ebay.com where you just click a button and you win this is an actual auction like a live streamed video of a guy with a gavel going do we get 6,000 over here 6,500 in the front row we got 6,800 on the phone do we hear 7,000 7,000 here and it just keeps going and you can participate from anywhere in the world so they were going through a bunch of stuff and the iPhone was item number 203 and so when they got to 203 I logged into the site and I had my initial offer placed which was the minimum of $32,000 the contents have been x-rayed verified going once going twice sold to the online bidder moving on I just won like that was the moment when I committed to uh figuring this whole thing out and so the rest of the price was just uh sales tax and uh bidding premium and shipping which feels like a really good time to say that this video is sponsored by you there's a lot of things that we could have spent $40,000 on like camera equipment for example but we decided to do this and so we've brought back the MKBHD mat black wallet it was super limited edition before but they were very popular so we're bringing them back in a slightly less limited edition at shop. MKBHD docomo really sick and now I can say that this video is made possible by my wallet the link is below please buy one have I made a huge mistake only one way to find out but uh it's time to dig into this gigantic [Music] crate so my biggest question as I get into this is how do I verify if this is actually brand new and Untouched by human hands like on the auction website we did see that there were uh there were some X-rays and the x-rays are cool and they make it feel really official but all we really know by seeing those x-rays is that the accessories are in fact in the Box we don't know if they're untouched and then the other thing about this is when you when you put in a serial number on like Apple's Checker uh you can see that it is not registered so whoever got this phone originally which I think they said the name of the original owner who brought it in uh never registered it it was never used it was never activated but that doesn't mean it was never opened so this this is very much uh a trust exercise so many layers this is like a Russian doll of OG Tech products now this is the one where I need to be careful I'm a professional guys it's fine this is fine there it is that is the packaging of this brand new but also not so brand new original iPhone you can see it's got a little bit of Browning around it I'm not too put off by that and some of the articles that I read on online after I bought it we saying basically this break here in the corner and uh some other factors are possibly why it went a little bit lower than the record $660,000 price it also has this upside down lucky you sticker every article that I've read that I've looked up about this lucky you sticker nobody seems to know what it is it's kind of confusing because it is super rare other original sealed iPhones don't have this sticker I even asked people at Apple they don't know what it means there are so many things I think people forgot about the original iPhone one is it didn't have an App Store so it was just the apps that were on it and two you couldn't set a wallpaper with the first version of iOS so everyone's iPhone looked exactly the same so without any further ado this is the moment that all the value just went from 40,000 to uh I don't know depends on how good the condition of the phone is but the plastic wrap the 16-year-old it it does have a smell ooh fancy so they had foam in the top of the boxes and this is the way it showed up facing you on the top wow I think that is actually brand new it's just a little thing just a nicely designed little Factory seal thing oh this is harder than a this happened in Justine's video this is a hard screen protector to take off okay so there's a little piece of plastic hard plastic actually then there's the documents signed designed by Apple in California I actually don't know if there's a sticker this is now all new territory for me despite it being old oh there's more there's a there's a whole microfiber inside that says iPhone on it interesting fingertips these are all the uh the tips for using and operating your iPhone in 2007 how to set a passcode how to send a message how to browse the web and uh oh the stickers are a little bit es skew is that how they were can you see those how there one of them is upside down and tilted the other one's right side up and tilted so it kind of it kind of looks on purpose but it also looks different cuz they're usually aligned now there is even more this is what I was talking about this is what was x-rayed by the auction house just to verify that they're here but they're all also still sealed in the box so usba a wall brick you also have a 30 pin dock with a headphone jack out on the back this is nice let's open the let's open the [Music] dock that is brand new wow it would look like that uh you also get two more things you get a 30 pin usba to 30 pin uh charging cable and data cable you plug this into iTunes plug it into your computer and ear pods this was back in the iconic days of well the sil commercials and the white headphones and plugging a wire into your phone that feels very legit I don't think it's going to turn on but I'm going to hold the power button anyway this is one of those things where like it's a 16-year-old battery of course it's not going to turn on that would be a pretty red flag actually if it did boot up if it okay it doesn't that's good this is this all just feels like exactly what they didn't want me to do when I bought this original iphone look at the difference between that brand new fresh piece of metal versus one that somebody was out using in their everyday lives so while I wait for this a little bit to probably take a minute to charge but I feel like I can say that with all that I know and all the research that I've done going into this purchase it seems like this one is legitimately brand new and unopened if anyone can tell me if anyone knows or if anyone who's watching this worked in Apple retail around the time in 2007 when the iPhone was launched what if this came from Apple or if this is something completely different I would love to know because that would be really interesting there's one story online about how it might have been like a holiday season sticker who knows all right we're back actually I'm back the next day hence the different shirt and the haircut but ignore that uh and I want to go over everything that I learned because we now have gotten the iPhone to turn on and I am convinced that it is an unopened original and I also learn some things about the iPhone 2 so first of all I am convinced that it's an unopen original because of this shrink wrap being super old because of the shrink wrap that was around the iPhone that was inside the Box being perfect looking and even the fact that it's actually surprisingly difficult to get a 1.0 iPhone to get past this uh iTunes boot screen if you actually download an old version of iTunes and plug it in and try to activate it it you can get surprisingly far and still not actually get it to activate that all sort of lends Credence to the fact that we could get other iPhones to activate because they had later versions of software long story short this is as far as we got with it and it does turn on and work the weird thing that we found was number one this is the original brick and the original cable that came with the iPhone we plugged them in overnight we came back in in the morning and it still didn't turn on but when we replaced the brick and not the cable it actually started to charge second thing to learn is there was no SIM card ejector tool with the iPhone at all but when you do grab a SIM card ejector tool and pop open the SIM card tray at the top you will find that there is a gigantic SIM card included with the iPhone so this was a AT&T Singular exclusive one it came out and look at the size of this SIM card this is the uh the original size SIM card back in the day before micro and nano SIM cards but then yeah I did not remember that it shipped with this doc until I did my research and I also didn't know it would ship with a black microfiber and these Apple stickers that are slightly a skew and this brand new pristine iPhone is now worth dramatically less than what I paid for it and that's okay so that'll be it hopefully I don't regret this thank you so much for watching and again if anyone knows what the lucky you sticker means definitely hit us up in the comments or on Twitter talk to you guys in the next one peace [Music] [Music] [Applause]","They scam like that because they see divvys like you markus spending money on pointless garbage | Can you somehow reach Tim Cook to get this iPhone to somehow work? | That ""ive actually seen people get scammed by this"" hit home (literally me). I ordered an origan iphone off ebay when they where actually new (AT&T), And i got scammed big time. The guy sent me an empty box that he shipped from literally 2 counties away but he insured it with the paypal instant label maker so when it showed up empty he could claim theft, he received his money back from UPS, and i got my money back from paypal. It was TRULY a sophisticated crime for its time. | You left it plugged in overnight damn. Suprised you had a office to go back to 🔥 | 9:12 I would honestly choose that over a MagSafe stand | Spending 40k on this is crazy...lucky he did it for us | It’s crazy how little we get from a new iPhone now package wise | See Apple used to give us everything, now is just the phone and a cable | did the video views pay for it? | Can you sell this iPhone back to me with $50,000 let me know."
wR-0knMVSGw,The Rivian R1S Is... The Best SUV Ever?,"Rivian R1S is an awesome, expensive SUV. That's on purpose. The podcast with RJ Scaringe: https://youtu.be/RdjDDtHvUXA ...",2023-04-11T23:20:19Z,2983782,80460,3630,[Music] the best SUV that you can buy right now just happens to be Electric okay that's probably that's a pretty controversial statement let's let's let's zoom out a little bit with uh maybe something we can all agree on like electric cars are really expensive right now that's just a fact I think we can all be on the same page about like there are basically no really really good but also really really cheap electric cars but that's not for a lack of trying like they all know that that would kill like a twenty thousand dollar Tesla would do amazing people would love to buy that that's just not something that's possible with the prices and the The Way businesses work right now so when I start just with the best SUV that you can buy happens to be electric that's actually a strategy let's zoom out a little bit so gas cars have been evolving as you know they've been maturing for years and years and then now this suddenly very new and very expensive technology comes along that is an electric drivetrain with a huge battery and so if you're a company that's going to add it to your car it will become a more expensive car so if you're a car company knowing that you want to start making electric vehicles you have a very specific choice to make and we get to like follow this in real time and see them all try to do this and that choice is do you want to compete at the highest end to be the best possible product or do you want to compete at the lowest end on price and of course business 101 if you've looked at these graphs long enough you can understand that it just makes more business sense to try now when the technology is expensive to compete on the highest End by just trying to make the best overall thing a no-brainer better product and then you know in the future when hopefully the price of the tech gets lower we can also get those that are competing on price that's why you're seeing cars that are expensive and electric and not a lot of cheap electric cars I mean there are some but they're more expensive than their gas counterparts so they don't really make sense so I guess then that brings us to the question is the rivion r1s the best SUV in the world is it the best one you can buy well it makes a pretty compelling case and I think it's really good so if you've heard me talk about the truck before the rivien r1t well then the name r1s makes a lot of sense because the front half is also R1 it's basically the same but the back half it trades the truck bed and the gear tunnel for a third row and all the benefits that come with a third row SUV form factor so literally like if one of these pulled up behind you from this angle you could not tell if that was the truck or the SUV that just pulled up behind you because it's identical and two come to the side and you see the differences now I've been driving this brand new Limestone colored r1s with the dark all-terrain wheels for about a week now it's been really solid and I'm not even going to highlight the front stuff because it's basically the same if you've seen the video go back and watch the r1t video it's the same truck it's the same interior not a lot interesting here so let's just do the part that's different now so let's take a look at the new uh and slightly improved interior I'm in the second row right now it's not as gigantic of a second row as like a Escalade or something gigantic like that but in a lot of its competition a lot of other three row SUVs perfectly reasonable and then behind me is the two seats of this seven seater which is smaller it's it's better for kids I wouldn't want to be back there for a road trip but it's fine it's comfortable you've got three kids this is the type of thing in the US you see a lot of and they've made a lot of subtle improvements even since the r1t that I first checked out obviously you've got this huge glass roof up here at the top there are slightly improved better speakers so the Meridian sound system that was in the previous one was fine actually was really good these I imagine are in roughly the same locations around the cabin but they sound way better and then still material choices are great and there are events everywhere really solid builds nothing's creaking or scratching or squeaking or anything like that this is this is nice but of course since it's three rows you want to know how to get back to the third row so so let's do that so there's a nice little button on the shoulder of the seat you press that it slides It Forward on these rails and you can just pop right back here into the back seat so look as predicted not a ton of leg room that's the seat right there but you do have the vents back here you also do have additional sunroof behind this little pillar here which feels pretty nice and you still have the entire trunk behind you spacious Airy at the light interior color helps of course but yeah that's the third row you didn't get with the r1t got a little cup holder back here there's a speaker over here the vents that you can point at yourself and of course on the other side same deal but I do want to show you the trunk space because I think that's what's the most important actually impressive so of course coming around to the back you still have that distinctive light bar across you still have the blinkers on either side but now if you want to open this lift gate here it automatically will pop open like that which kind of reminds me I think a Jeep Wagoneer or something does this but you've got this sort of split gate the top half opens the bottom half stays closed so if you've got stuff sort of uh rolling around in here it's protected it'll stay in then this button right here will pop this section down and it's got this little clever mechanism here that creates this sort of flat surface as it slides open so now you can slide things in here and if you even want you can use these locking and unlocking bits here that can slide around lock into place and then tie things down to the other side so if you've got something that's actually going to stick out the back and you don't have enough room that can help you out now I mentioned there's no gear tonal but they even kept things like what you find in the truck bed which is 1500 watts of power and you also have your air compressor back here so all that's still good you still get to keep it there's also this giant subwoofer on the other side but of course if this is going to be the best thriller SUV it's got to do better than this right I mean all the seats are up that's fine for groceries I guess but you already know it's electric so that means there's even more space where there wouldn't be a gas tank that's your first aid kit this is I believe a charging kit or Tire compressor yep air compressor and then even more sub trunk space but just go ahead and pull this up real quick and you'll find an even more gigantic area underneath where you could put a spare if you had one but you don't so you just have a ton more space where you put groceries that won't slide around and all of that is closable and hideable under this flat surface but I do think it's time to put the seats down just so you can see how ridiculous it gets when you put all that space down actually this is kind of a sweet setup for me if I don't have all the seats needed at once this is a sort of a giant flat area where you can fit a ton of stuff I'll try to put numbers on the screen if there are any available to sort of contextualize how much that is and then of course I can't reach from back here but you've got the buttons to pop the last two all the way down I don't know why the headrests don't go down but when they do go down it's just this gigantic massive amount of space you could fit a bike or two back here and still have the front seats it's it's pretty sick so does having enough space for a mattress folded down make it the best SUV in the world not by itself no I mean the sub trunk space is great you also can't forget about the front trunk which the r1t also had and all the power tool stuff and all the space and the green roof and oh yeah and then you gotta drive it of course spoiler alert this one's also really fun to drive which is probably not a shock to anyone who knew anything about the r1t because yes this one is also a quad motor 800 horsepower missile in a straight line it is absurd it has no right being this fast being seven thousand Pounds but it is so it is that fun again now the difference with this in the r1t is this one is a little bit of a shorter wheelbase which means it does actually feel a little bit more Nimble it does like when I corner or when I turn around on like a tight Road like this it does have a smaller overall turning radius which is great um it also means if you're off-roading you have a better break over angle all these things like most people will not use 75 of the capabilities of this vehicle but if you do uh that'll be really good to know but again just like in regular driving okay I'm gonna be in all-purpose mode because that's the typical Mo you'll drive around in this thing and uh it drives like as good as any other SUV you could possibly imagine meaning soft suspension check firm acceleration if you want it but very relaxed and drivable all the rest of the time check regen great stability control great no problems here this is It's I I couldn't expect much more but now you can go into sport mode because if you're going to spend a lot of money and you want it to be the best overall product you can hear the air suspension literally lowering it as I go into the lowest overall setting and now the firmest most responsive mode and it should be able to do both right if it's going to be a super expensive best overall product it should be able to do both and this is maybe the only place that I could possibly see anyone complaining which is that it's not the sportiest thing in the world it actually does drive a little bit looser than the r1t which is interesting this feels like a suspension thing but a lot of the accelerations and decelerations and the way its sways a little bit back and forward and going around turns I feel a little bit extra swaying where I didn't expect it you could argue that that's a weakness of this particular vehicle sure but in literally 99 of the cases especially with 99 of the drivers nobody's uh actually ever going to notice so I've been really really impressed and just having a lot of fun with it I actually find I find it fine to just be in all-purpose mode most of the time I also don't have that much off-roading in my daily commute or my normal use of this vehicle so that's also fine but if I did I would have off-road mode snow Mode's cool to have uh of course if I was Towing something I could pull that off too the only thing I really tow is a camera rig so I wouldn't get this if I was towing a whole ton of weight you should watch Jerry everything's video where he actually did test out how well it would tow actually he had an r1t for that video but I wouldn't get it for that either but this just really fits the uh that is Nimble this just fits the it fits the adventure vehicle Mantra it really feels like it matches that description Adventure vehicle so it's like all right Marquez if you're gonna call the best what is it competing against well if you're just going straight six row SUV there's a lot of them out there and America loves these things they're the Toyota Highlanders or the I think that's a Honda Pilot right there that's a three row lots of things that will all be cheaper than this dramatically cheaper than this one I think even the Escalade the Cadillac Escalade will be cheaper than this rivian r1s but what this rivian r1s does is it's able to offer all of the things that you want out of the vehicle like this and doesn't really skimp so some of those might be really comfortable and well built but they won't be as high tech or they might be really high tech and well built but they won't be as fast you see what I mean now this is the electric one too so it's going to be the quietest it's going to be the most responsive the most efficient it's going to have the most space and those are all benefits kind of over all of the other six seven seat SUVs so I think if the mission is just like make a great thing that's just the most fun for the people who don't really have a budget and just want to go crazy and have the coolest best thing uh I don't think that there's much else that I would take over this one like if you just pressed a button then I had three kids and I had to daily Drive something that could you know go get groceries take them all to school and just have a fun time in otherwise this would be uh this would be pretty good now the question for everyone else is like okay when is this experience when is the electric vehicle experience that's actually fun and good going to come down in price and that's just a tech and a Development question keep in mind this company also has to spend money on building a charging Network and all the other things they're doing with the delivery Vans I keep seeing the rivian delivery vans on the road all the time because there's an Amazon Warehouse near here so I feel like I see one like every single day but you know that's just one company rivian's doing stuff Tesla's doing stuff a bunch of other Rock Solid companies that have been making cars for a long time are all starting to make EVs and develop them and spend money and lower the price slowly but we'll eventually get there I actually talked to the CEO of rivian RJ on my podcast this week I'll link it below if you want to listen to that but we talked about the R2 platform and what that's designed to do to be a lower priced version of this same experience and if they're able to accomplish that in as short as a year from now we're already moving in the right direction so look I really like this thing uh whether it's the best SUV ever or not you know that'll be up for debate I I really like it I've had a lot I think people just have fun with it in general that's pretty obvious but I am really impressed with this first effort from this particular company and I'm hoping they're able to continue because r1t and r1s really set the tone for what we can expect from rivian in the future and hopefully we get a bunch of other cool EVS following in those footsteps and lowering and price sometime soon please okay that's been it thanks for watching if you want to watch the the podcast with with RJ or even uh watch the autofocus videos that I make on all kinds of other thoughts on cars I'll leave both those links below if you want to check them out and I'll catch y'all in the next one see you over there peace,"Cadillac turned out to be way more expensive.  Come on EV Tahoe! | Great review | looking tired af in this video | This car is actually beautiful | 11:50 - ""...for the people who don't really have a budget.""

Have you seen the prices of the competition? All the comparable gas models are pretty similar price. When you factor in the Rivian's benefits of electric, there's simply no comparison, unless your trips are more than ~380mi. | I would lower the 3 row for my daily commutes and it’s spacious. | That looks like Rt 280 in Jersey(Newark area) | The quad motor is 1,025 HP and the Tri motor is 850 HP. | Can't wait for R3 and Rivian actually coming to EU markets ❤❤❤.
MKBHD when are you driving new G-Class electric ⚡⚡😊 | The Rivian R1S stands out as a powerful, high-end SUV designed for those who demand luxury and performance. Toyota bZ4X offers efficiency and reliability with a sleek design for those looking for an eco-friendly, stylish, and dependable electric SUV."
AFthdsIcOxw,This Voice is Entirely AI...,I have a theory about this generative AI The full song: https://youtu.be/y7r6PAkFRfU MKBHD Merch: http://shop.MKBHD.com Tech ...,2023-04-03T23:28:54Z,1892909,80739,4559,foreign so I have a theory and I don't know what to call this or if I should name it or anything but here's my theory so the really impressive part about artificial intelligence is that as it gets better and better it feels more and more like human intelligence right which is why we use that word to the point where it can actually pass for human intelligence in some cases like it passes tests it solves problems it finds patterns it mimics things and so it can actually kind of fool you into thinking it's intelligent and so now we have this generative AI that can be trained on massive data sets and spit out unique outputs that are increasingly impressive now to be clear AI like artificial intelligences that have been better at humans at some things that's been around for a while like that was kind of the point actually they could comb through large amounts of data and find patterns that humans never would like literally detect disease in its earliest stage of development better than an actual doctor so AI has already been useful but where it's generative AI that we're talking about where we're asking AI to be creative and come up with new things new text new images new sounds that's what I'm talking about that's the scary one so my theory my theory is there are two levels of success of efficiently Advanced AI the first level is when AI generated content fools you because you weren't paying attention to AI or like looking for AI so maybe you like me saw the pope photo on your timeline a couple days ago and like just kept scrolling you just thought oh that's a weird picture of the Pope kind of a cool jacket I guess but only when you get told that it's Ai and not a real picture does it trigger your skeptical eye and suddenly you're like oh that's obviously not a real picture there's so many things wrong the hands look weird the details are garbled of course it's a fake picture but the second level of AI generated content fooling you is when you know you're supposed to be looking at AI and it still fools you that's when it gets scary so we've had a couple examples of the like level one instances like the pope photo like I mentioned there have been others floating around like there was one of like Trump getting arrested even though he didn't but what's level two I got an email a couple weeks ago from an artist you may be familiar with Mr Jay Maderos wanna have Alta and veinsil and they had a new track that they were working on which was a collab where he wraps alongside Jay-Z except the Jay-Z voice is not real it's AI generated and they were going back and forth on like how to release this whether or not they should release it at all like I want you to listen to this like not the whole thing I'll play a little bit of it for you you should still go to the source and absolutely watch the original video I'll link it below but I just needed to hear this and feel what I felt when I first heard this song [Music] they can never become what they aspire to born in a cell with no one who can inspire you your hazard was never as high as it was a lie to you pretending that they live in the sky lying behind your roof shooting hoes up at your ceiling so for those of you who know what Jay-Z sounds like that was absurd like that sounded a lot like Jay-Z to the point where even knowing that I'm listening to AI generated content I can still hear it and sort of enjoy it like I'm actually listening to Jay-Z it's a lot now to be clear Mr Jamie Jones told me they wrote those lyrics before the AI tools became available and the tools I used weren't even Plug and Play Perfect like there were still lots of layers to it tweaking things experimenting with different methods apparently words like feeling and sealing and appealing were like hard to get it to rhyme because they'd pronounced it slightly differently so they ran it through a bunch of times but the fact that it's still so good in the final result that's what opens up the can of worms it's kind of borderline scary knowing how good it actually is just knowing that I'm listening to Ai and still enjoying it like it's Bars by Jay-Z and the cherry on top is that this is the worst this technology will ever be so there's examples of level one everywhere like low stakes content where it passes because the audience isn't really looking for AI and it doesn't really matter like it's true of a lot of the chatbot stuff too like Chachi PT and Bard and all the others like Bing they might write an email you might read an email that seems pretty sincere but turns out most of it was written by one of those chat Bots and it's kind of fine because it's just an email but just keep in mind that the goal of all of these Technologies is to advance to get to level two like the goal of the chat bot eventually when it gets better is to be able to pass as a human in conversation what does that mean and the goal of the the image generator is to be able to produce usable paintings or drawings or whatever like a human what does that mean the goal of self-driving cars is to drive alongside other humans on the road and that's wild but that's that's what they're all working towards so is there a solution to this I mean the answer really is not yet it's so new that there is no answer some people think regulation some people think uh just outright Banning it is an option I don't really believe in that but I think what's going to have to happen is there probably has to be some sort of a parallel development of tools that are specifically designed to detect AI content so that you need to learn to deploy those tools when there's a reason to detect AI but for now let's enjoy level one because you won't have just that for much longer thanks for watching catch you in the next one peace Savage,"I get the mystery and curiosity of it all, i get the aspect of its purpose in driving efficiency… but what I’m lost for is why do we work so hard to delve into this space of curiosity which ultimately removes anything humans do whether its for personal growth or to sustain life….? There are so many things that build personal character and it seems as though we will become an empty shell while we outsource all of the things that make us individuals. Once this takes hold of 85% or more of life’s basic functions, what happens to the cognitive brain connections such as memory, learning ourselves, penmanship, remembering telephone numbers or even how to do basic math problems…. There will be no more Michael Jordans and Kobe Bryants spending 24 hours in the gym daily honing in on their shot which require scenarios to develop their spontaneity.. there will no longer be competition between humans to play chess against each other and we will undoubtedly loose to ai. What’s the challenge there?  The future seems to only hold the concept of chasing programming. I get the entrepreneurs it will breed by way of deception and faceless business ventures. Not a lot of us have a comfortable financial position in life to just sit back and enjoy life…. So I’m not sure where this will place us in the so called near future! I have been telling people for many years now about this book called… “The Robots Are Coming” by an author, last name Oppenheimer. I think it is a precursor to acceptance and an opportunity to prepare for this future. For now, its fun, but sad having a view point of how it will affect us negatively as humans. | 0:09 a tech theory 😂 | Denmark ❤ thank you | This could be AI as wrll. | Marques’ voice hasn’t changed since 2012 | Can we analyze the 911 call made by Mica Miller on 4/27/24 if it was truly here? We have many reasons to believe it was an AI. She was murdered by her husband and he made it look like a suicide. He stated that she didn’t like AI | That sounded exactly like Jay. Scarily accurate actually. I wanted to hear more, didn't care if it was really him or not. Idk why people in the comments were lying lol | I would love to hear Aaliyah & Left Eye on the SAME track.... as an example. So yes this does sound intriguing, as disturbing as it is. | This makes me think of that scene in Tango & Cash. It’s gonna get scary in the future.  Criminals are gonna have a field day with this tech🤔 | Those bars did feel like Jay-Z, reminds me of Reasonable Doubt. He's one of my most listened to & favourite artists, so while listening to the track it felt so familiar that it was as though I could rhyme alongside it 

I'd love to use AI generation for music & voices to make full-cast, dramatized audiobooks reminiscent of some of my favourite audiobooks, like: Star Wars 'Tempest Runner' or Brandon Sanderson's 'Warbreaker' "

4PZSB9bV1Zg,Tesla&#39;s Wireless Charger: Explained!,It's expensive. But it's built like a tank. https://shop.tesla.com/product/wireless-charging-platform.,2023-03-22T21:37:22Z,4969178,210640,1524,right I finally got my hands on it this is Tesla's newest piece of merch a 300 wireless charger now you might have seen the headlines about this being hailed as like Tesla making air power where Apple failed and it's kinda like that but not exactly so what it is is a collaboration with a company called free Power whose Tech is basically using a bunch of overlapping coils and really clever software to give you the ability to place your device anywhere on the mat and it'll direct your charge it's pretty sick it works well and you can actually drop up to three things on here up to 15 watts each just no Apple watch since that's not QI charging but actually just as impressive as the tech is the build quality this is actually the best built wireless charger I've ever used so it has this angular aluminum design kind of like a cyber truck and then this Alcantara surface like the headliner and the cars even the brick and the flat cable built in look kind of cybery and then there's this metal stand with magnets that lets you prop it up at different angles and it is Rock Solid is this worth 300 bucks probably not but this probably is the first time Tesla's had the best built product in any category,"It also fries your phone battery | I'm supposed to buy this and the charging pad in my MYP isn't even that great | Cool, but not £300 cool | Beautiful wireless charger I've seen 👍 | Wireless charging* not air charging. Air charging means your phone charges from a transistor simultaneously without coming in contact with a wireless charging object. | tesla industrial design is like architecture's brutalism style: when an era's ethos again matches trends in culture. | heat? | They should have a whole line of charger even 1000 watts to continuous charger a car while it's running or team with nothing phone to make a phone | Nicola Tesla figured out how to convert power without contact i will do the same | Qué buena historia y qué buen video, me gustó mucho, espero la siguiente parte.

b7zBJNmdImo,This Smartphone Hardware is Getting Crazy!,"This phone isn't even getting released outside of China, but damn, this hardware is good. That hoodie! http://shop.MKBHD.com ...",2023-03-21T10:17:15Z,2883987,92214,3641,foreign look at this thing this is the Oppo Find X6 Pro now I've talked about oppo's find X Series smartphones before they've made some pretty wild stuff in the past this X6 Pro is not even coming to the US it's apparently going to be China only but I've gotten actually use it for about a week and it's got me thinking smartphone Hardware has gotten so ridiculously capable and this being at the top of the Heap is so capable that I think we might actually be taking it for granted a little bit so okay let's back up aesthetically slab smartphones have all kind of started to look the same we are all on the same page about that this one actually kind of manages to spice it up a little bit with this half vegan leather on the bottom which kind of has a little texture to it which is nice and then the top half and the rails are like this satin metal so it is a bit different and I actually like it a lot but you know that's the Apple find series for you they've been really good at spicing it up from the standard slab formula for a number of years and they try all sorts of interesting stuff there are some solid colored versions of this phone as well but this is the one that really makes a statement but none of that is even really what I'm talking about in this video what I am talking about is what's under the hood get it under the hood because of the Good hoodie anyway uh yeah under the hood here so Chinese software aside I can just tell that because this is a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 with 16 gigs of RAM with fast storage and great other supporting specs I feel pretty comfortable saying that it's going to go well but there are three main areas just that I just want to appreciate with smartphone Hardware capability right now so the first one is the battery now okay here's the way we normally think of smartphone battery right like what was a good smartphone battery life like eight nine ten years ago it's like oh all day if it could last all for an entire day of battery life that'd be pretty good now fast forward all the way to 2023 and what what is a good smartphone battery life it's it's one day all of a day maybe two days if you're lucky so it doesn't feel like it's it's Advanced that much but of course you need to consider the amount of stuff our smartphones are doing has gotten way more dramatic much more powerful processing bigger screens way more radios these things are way more power hungry so for those older smartphones and all-day battery life meant having like a 2000 to 3 000 milliamp hour battery and then even as recently as like three years ago you could either get like a 5 000 milliamp hour battery with slower charging or you could get like a 3000 milliamp hour battery and have blazing fast charging but now it's 2023 we can have both now this one's got a 5 000 milliamp hour battery that also charges at a hundred Watts wired or even 50 watts wireless charging so with a cable that 100 Watts will do zero to 100 in 30 minutes but even through what they're calling air vook wireless charging because I got to name everything with the right accessory you can get 50 charge in 22 minutes on the wireless charger so it's kind of sick plus there's all the battery extras and modes to ideally help keep the battery healthy and optimized so that you can fast charge as much as you want without damaging a thing it learns your schedule does that whole dance this one even has an ultra low temperature charging mode I think any phone could probably have this mode if they programmed it but basically what this phone is doing is if it detects you're in extreme cold like 0 to negative 25 degrees Celsius so it's your freeze it's it's Canada in the middle of the winter something crazy and so it's really cold the battery's really cold but batteries need to be in a certain temperature range to charge quickly like somewhere around room temperature so if you plug it in in that extreme coal then it needs to rapidly charge it will actually run an artificial load through the computer through the processor like basically Benchmark itself over and over again to start to generate heat in the computer to warm up the phone to get the battery to a better temperature to charge quickly so even at the end of the day if it's still you know if it was 10 years ago all-day battery life and now today it's still all-day battery life I still think it's way more impressive now than it was back then so that's number one the battery then number two is this display so you know watching this through a compression through a website on YouTube video and then on the screen of your phone you won't be able to tell how awesome this screen is like you'll just see another phone with thin bezels and some slightly curved edges and a hole punch cut out for the selfie camera looking pretty normal I remember not that long ago when we were first getting retina displays and smartphones we were getting basically right over the 300 pixels per inch 300 PPI limit where you can't really discern individual pixels anymore that was back in the like iPhone 4S days where it was like a 60 hertz flat LCD but it was like oh it's a retina display but this screen this display here on a smartphone this is a 6.82 inch diagonal with a 3168 by 1440 resolution that's 510 pixels per inch for anybody counting razor sharp but you can turn it down to 1080p anytime it's also an AMOLED display with ltpo so it goes all the way up to 120 hertz and all the way down to 1 Hertz when it doesn't need to be moving at all to be efficient and it has a 240Hz touch sample rate it's extremely responsive to the touch whether it's scrolling or swiping around or gaming it also has adjustable color settings to get it looking exactly dialed the way you want and by the way it has a max Peak brightness of 2 500 nits so there's pretty much no situation whether it's in the dash of your car or outdoors in direct sunlight there's no situation where it's not bright enough to be readable which is dope all while housing a pretty standard really quick Optical fingerprint sensor and the hole punch camera you saw with the cutout for the selfie camera at the top do I wish it was more flat yeah if I was gonna daily this phone I'd want a more flat display than this but I mean this is the Oppo Find X thing that's what they always do they try to go a little fancy a little spicy with the hardware so I almost give it a pass because I expected that but this display is world class it's hard to appreciate on the camera but if you show this display or those numbers because people eight nine years ago it would be nuts so that's two then three is the camera I mean you look at a phone like this and it's pretty clear what the focus is that's fun but the camera system on the backs of these phones has swelled up more and more over the years especially on the flagships at this point it's damn near half the back of the phone this one is a triple camera setup so one standard one Ultra wide and one Periscope Zoom now those first two categories display and Battery are less software dependent like you can basically brute force your way into having a good one if you just buy a good enough part like you don't need good software to have a great display just buy a good display and optimization helps but like if you buy a huge battery you'll have a pretty good battery life but cameras are a little different cameras as we talked about are mostly I mean it's a lot of software work that goes into determining the character of the photos and videos you get out of a smartphone camera it's basically a computer and so in order to separate yourself at the very top of smartphone cameras something like this like a flagship actually needs to combine the two if you want to give your software the best chance of succeeding you need to give it the best information possible and so this is trying to do both so let's not even worry about the megapixel count but just the sheer size of the sensors in here and their light Gathering abilities and then the quality of the lenses they're able to fit in front of them this is a primary camera that is a 50 megapixel one inch type sensor with Optical stabilization and a 1.8 aperture and so while it still has to be oppo's software that does all the processing that is most of the work in creating a photo nowadays it absolutely makes a big difference to give that computer as much light and as much information as possible so that's what's going on the biggest thing is that these huge sensors tend to struggle with is actually minimum Focus distance and close-up subjects so thankfully this system also has a massive 1 over 1.56 inch Ultra wide sensor with an F 2.2 aperture and it also happens to have a four centimeter minimum Focus system so you can take close-up shots and it's got this built-in macro mode to handle most of the weaknesses of the primary camera and there's a matching identical actually large sensor behind the 3x Periscope camera and that one also has an F 2.6 aperture so they are all 50 megapixel cameras they can also all do a 2X crop and still be very detailed so that kind of makes it feel like the 1X camera is now a 1X and a 2X and the 3x camera is both a 3X and a 6X but then you'll know Samsung phones will go to the extra mile and also include a 10x camera which can also crop if you want to so they'll go like as much Zoom versatility as possible but the point is yeah we're throwing Hardware at it now and it works it's important still camera systems like this were just kind of not on the radar a few years ago especially because designs wouldn't really allowed it like we just kind of got used to gigantic bumps on the back of phones so the downside or maybe upside depending on how you see it is phones today just have bigger and bigger camera bumps on the back to house all these massive sensors and big Optics but this one I actually don't really mind maybe you feel the same way they've embraced the Hasselblad branding obviously they also put this whole thing in a huge circle and then it has this nice knurled ring around the camera Circle that reminds me of those like nice especially Hasselblad cameras it's got the dot in the middle which is typically where you'd line up a lens to put it on so it kind of It kind of plays it well it looks fine also there's a couple phones with like huge camera bumps where I like that the bottom of it is right in the spot that matches where my finger rests on the back of the phone so I actually use the camera bump to hold up the back of the phone comfortably and this is one of them this phone also happens to have the fastest storage we've seen in Android phones it's ufs 4.0 storage has the fastest Ram has the fastest Wi-Fi as Wi-Fi 7 capable it also has fantastic haptics all of that is enabled by hardware and this isn't even really the most powerful smartphone out like let's be honest it's going to be the gaming phones again that level up this chipset give it crazy cooling like overclock it they'll do nuts things they'll prioritize different things they'll have a higher refresh rate screen they'll have big front-facing speakers and things like that others might prioritize design in a way that's like extra thin different phones do different things and that's not even touching the whole battle being fought over how folding phone form factors should work because there are a lot of options out there and that is all hardware and that is all still very interesting but just as far as the standard slab smartphone these these pieces of Hardware would be like Unthinkable eight seven six years ago so that's pretty cool thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace [Music],"Who is in 2024 | You should review the oppp x7 Ultra  I have it and it's amazing. | Oppo are great. | you gotta review the x100

W9_NAXd6VyE,A Rare iPhone Environmental W,One small step...,2023-02-27T21:29:39Z,11159494,454880,9259,so if you have an iPhone in the US you may have noticed that on the latest 16.3.1 update Apple flipped a switch on everyone's phones that makes charging slower is what some of the headlines would say but the real story is actually really interesting so if you look now in battery health settings there's a new setting called clean energy charging and what it does is it tries to reduce your carbon footprint by only charging when your house is likely to be pulling from cleaner sources of energy based on your local electrical grid that is kind of wild luckily you can override it you'll get a notification that says it's not charging and waiting for clean energy you can bypass it but the interesting thing about this one is this setting is opt out meaning if you go to check your settings it's going to be on by default now you know charging your one iPhone at slightly more optimized hours won't make a big difference to your own personal carbon footprint but Apple flipping a switch for millions and millions of iPhones at once will probably in total make a really big difference to total energy saved a rare W for the environment I also can guarantee this would be in a slide at the next Apple keynote,"Clean energy setting available since last 2 years at least | Clean energy = expensive . | Apple shouldn't be fucking with people's phones like this, I can guarantees more than a few people thought their phone was broken as a result of this especially if there was no warning on the phone that option was added and enabled | But how it's gonna recognise whether it's clean energy?? | Nz has none of this | I will immediately turn it off | Accelerate your car harder for 2 seconds and your carbon footprint is back to the baseline 😂😂😂 | “Try” | Not rare MKBHD corporate bootlicking | That sound is millions running to the settings to turn it off"

really good reason for it. So AI has been blowing up
lately, both in the news and in real life applications
across a ton of industries. So, you know, years ago it was only in relatively small things
like helping doctors detect cancer early using
advanced pattern recognition, and then a little bit more over the years with things like autonomous vehicles. But now AI is everywhere. It's creating whole
original pieces of art. It's holding conversations
with humans all over the place. It seems like we've just arrived at the beginning of the AI age. There's this chart that keeps popping up that hits extra hard, which is the time to
reach 100 million users. And you can see the faster
and faster adoption curves with these increasingly
disruptive new technologies. So the telephone took 75 years to hit this milestone 100 million number. Then the mobile phone reached the same mark in just 16 years. Netflix took only 10 years. and Twitter took six and
Gmail only took five. Facebook in 48ish months
was absolutely massive. Instagram hit it in just 30 months. Now TikTok we view as this
gigantic existential threat, nine months to 100 million users. ChatGPT, two months. I mean, looking at numbers
like that, like I buy it, like it seems almost
obvious that we're clearly on the precipice of
something really, really big that's gonna change everything. So seeing Microsoft at the forefront of it with this new Bing shouldn't
really be a surprise. I mean, people are already
talking to these chatbots and asking it all sorts of questions. So it sort of feels natural having this chatbot act as
your co-pilot for the web alongside search instead of just a traditional
search engine full of links. Like, that sounds pretty sick. But there is one thing that's gonna follow this conversational AI
thing everywhere it goes, everywhere you see it, which is that sometimes it's just wrong. Sometimes it just says
things that aren't true because fundamentally the AI doesn't know if it's telling the truth or not. It doesn't understand that, like that's not part of the model. Like what we're seeing
is it taking our inputs and then creating outputs
based on related words that are most likely to go together. It's not forming a
sentence like humans do, it's generating a new sentence. And so adding it to a
search engine like Bing, it's scraping all these relevant links and information and
synthesizing new sentences just based on how it thinks things should be pieced together. It's not sentient, it doesn't
understand what it's saying and so it's definitely
not fact checking itself. So we have to keep that in the back of our mind
through all of this, right? Every time you see a headline. So it's really interesting with
these search engines, right? Because on one hand you have Bing who has everything to gain,
and then on the other hand you have Google who
has everything to lose. I've had access to this
new Bing for a little bit. It's a limited preview before they push it live
to the rest of the world. I've just been playing around with it. Basically, it adds this chat experience alongside regular Bing. It's essentially the same experience as talking to ChatGPT, but
instead of being limited to a fixed data set that
cuts off at 2021, it'll pull from the entire current web
that Bing can scrape from. So like I said, you
can type in a question, flip it over to chat, and it'll give you a sort of nicely written
summary that's synthesized based on what it finds
for similar queries. So if I ask it something kind of simple like what's the average lifespan
of a cheetah in the wild? Gives me an answer, right? It gives me a convincing
bunch of sentences. It actually gives me more
information than I ask for. It tells me about
cheetahs and captivity too which makes it, you know,
feel very convincing. It also gives little
footnotes and citations for some of its sources,
and it gives links at the end if you want
to dig in some more. It's really impressive, actually. It looks good to me. This is like a real
product that's gonna ship to all over the world,
like people everywhere in the next month or
two, I think they said. But this could only come
from Bing right now. Like, the more you use it the natural language is
super, super impressive. The fact that it gives
me a convincing sounding couple of sentences in a row and strings it together based
on my input, super cool. But the more you use it, the more you start to
see these weird patterns and these habits and these shortcomings. Again, mostly in the fact that sometimes it's just gonna be wrong. A little game I like to
play is ask it a question you already know the answer to and then read what it
says and spot the error. So I asked it right now, okay, what are the best smartphone
cameras right now? And it gave me S23 Ultra, Pixel 7 Pro, and iPhone 14 Pro Max with this nice little writeup
with some specs for each. That's actually a pretty good list, but it is wrong about some
of these numbers here. The S23 Ultra has a 200 megapixel camera and a 12 megapixel front facing camera. But yeah, okay, it's mostly right. I then asked it, what are the five best electric
vehicles out right now? And it gives me some,
five reasonable options. But I don't know any expert
that would put the Jaguar I-Pace on their list right now
and leave the Rivian off. Like, basically the answers that it gives are really convincing to someone who doesn't know anything
already about that subject. But if you are already an expert in the subject that you ask it about, then you'll find that
the answers are like, C plus, maybe B plus sometimes at best. So now you see what's happening, like now suddenly when
you're asking ChatGPT or Bing about a factual thing or
something you need help with, suddenly you also should
probably add these layers on top. Like, am I a complete newb in this topic that I'm asking it about? Am I just willing to blindly trust whatever this spits out
without any further research? Is a B plus answer gonna
be good enough for me even if it might have some
possible errors in it? You know, that might be good
enough for just asking like, you know, how old a cheetah
gets or something like that but maybe not good enough for planning a trip or meal planning for someone with an allergy
or something like that. And then if you look around the internet, people have gotten it to give increasingly more and more
unhinged answers over time as it tries to simulate conversations and stay in the flow
with natural language. I've seen anywhere from arguing about simple corrections
to spewing weird stories about how it's spied on its own developers or how it wants to be sentient, to gaslighting people about things and lying about its previous answers and just saying some
straight up scary stuff. Just go to the Bing subreddit for like, an all you can eat helping of all the insane stuff that Bing has said to just the people testing it
over the past couple weeks. Like, can you imagine, can you
imagine if Google did this, if Google search, at the
top of search for people was just spewing out random
stories and misinformation and like, all kinds of
insane, unhinged things. That would not fly. Now to be fair, this version of Bing isn't out yet
to the public, right? So it is still a small
group testing phase, but even with this, like
Microsoft knew that some of it is gonna get out there
and potentially go viral. It feels like they even
basically programmed in lots of friendly emojis
to try to soften the blow. So when it knows it's giving an answer to maybe a more controversial topic or something that it doesn't
have a super clear answer for, you might get a little
smiley face at the end just so you don't, you
know, take it too seriously. Also, literally as of today
when I'm testing this, it started completely
bailing on a lot of topics that might just be the
slightest bit existential or dangerous. It just says, hmm, I prefer not to continue
this conversation. And then it just stops. Just refuses to answer any more questions on that topic until you reset it. Which seems like a pretty good failsafe. It's a pretty good idea in hindsight. But we've already seen the other stuff. It's gotten out there,
the damage has been done. Like, the point still stands, this could have only come from Bing. Like, a lot of people might
have forgotten about this or might not have even known about this, but Google has been working on conversational AI stuff for years. We've seen Google Assistant. But they also literally
showed an AI chatbot demo on stage at Google IO in 2021 where you could have this whole
conversation with any person or object or anything in the
universe that you wanted. Their demo on stage was
asking Pluto about itself, nice and friendly, right? Oh, what's it like to be you, Pluto? What would it feel like if I visited you? How do you feel so far from the sun? The difference with Google is this was
never shipped as a product. Like, this was an
internal research project. But the idea of displacing
their massive search and ads business with a chatbot that gets things wrong
all the time is insane. It can't happen, right? So literally, search and
ads is more than half of Google's revenue as a company. That's what having everything
to lose looks like. Now, to be fair, Google
did hold an event in Paris the day after Microsoft's event, which was them talking a little more about their chat with search
AI plans, and they did say they're planning on eventually doing a chat
bot on top of Google search. It's called Bard. It was much more subdued though, and yes, it also literally did
have a factual mistake in the promo for it. So look, I actually like the idea, I obviously think it's smart when you're on the precipice
of this huge AI thing to have AI kind of be
this co-pilot for the web, to help you around the internet. The idea of it summarizing a longer piece into some bullet points accurately
is, that would be great. Like the fact that it
could give you sparknotes for a longer book you
haven't read yet, cool. It could even help you meal
plan, help you plan a trip, help you make a purchase decision. But it's clear that we're
still at the beginning of this. Like, there are so many
unanswered questions from obviously the fact checking to like, do schools embrace this or ban this? Or like, how do search
engines keep sending traffic to the publishers who are the sources that the chatbot is scraping from? I mean, you get the links at the bottom but a lot of people are not
gonna click those anymore if you just give 'em the answer
above the search results. So right now, in its current stage my take is anything we do
with any of these AI tools should be a collaboration
with the human touch. Like, you wouldn't just
put in a query in DALL-E and then just take whatever it generates and put it in a frame and
just call that art, right? It's more for inspiration for
your own paint and canvas. Like you wouldn't ask
ChatGPT to write an essay and then just copy and paste
it and submit it as your own. It's supposed to be the
inspiration for the framework for your own piece, for the human touch. So of course you shouldn't
ask the Bing chatbot what TV you should buy and then just like, mindlessly click and buy
the first one that comes up. I mean, it could be fine but it could also be a C plus answer. You should use that as a springboard for your own more informed research, especially on topics that you
don't already know much about. Like, maybe don't just buy
19 backpacks immediately when asking if it can fit
in the back of a Tesla. Maybe check its work first. Thanks for watching. Catch you the next one. Peace. (playful music)","I can’t tell you how much my brain broke when I clicked on the Marques Brownlee video and I saw the WAN show

zhoTX0RRXPQ,The Galaxy S23 Ultra is Better Than You Think!,Samsung's Galaxy S23 Ultra is a great minor (minor great) upgrade. That shirt! http://shop.MKBHD.com Get dbrand's Damascus ...,2023-02-11T00:01:15Z,6778130,194211,10077,"(upbeat techno music) - Matte black glass, aluminum
rails, massive specs, quad cameras, a hidden stylus, oh wait, wait, hang on a sec. Yeah, no, that was the wrong phone, sorry. Let's start that over. (upbeat techno music) Matte black glass, aluminum rails, massive specs, quad
cameras, a hidden stylus. You get the plan. (upbeat techno music continues) Hey, what's up, MKBHD here, and this is the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. So, when this first came
out, when it got revealed, it was the easiest thing to do to just write it off as
an incremental upgrade, because I mean, look at it. Aesthetically speaking, it's
basically the same phone. The side radii are squared off more, so it feels a bit better
in the hand, sure, much more boxy like the notes of the past. They're also slightly bigger
rings around the cameras, and it's Gorilla Glass Victus
2 instead of Victus Plus, but as far as size, industrial
design, button placement, ports, the layout, it's
basically the same phone. But there are two real
upgrades to this phone. Now keep in mind, this is
replacing the Galaxy S22 Ultra, which was already my best
big phone of the year from last year, great battery, great screen, great performance, all of it was rock solid across the board, so there's not a lot that I
would naturally want to change. But, there are two things, and they're two of arguably
the most important things you can actually change in a phone, the chip that runs it all and the cameras. So you might have heard
about the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. It's been a really good chip in the other phones that it's been in, excellent CPU and GPU performance and really efficient which
touches battery life. Now, this phone, actually
the whole S23 lineup, has a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy, a customized version of the chip, specifically for these Samsung phones. So if you watched the last video about how Apple's taking back the iPhone, then you know already that optimization and customization for parts inside phones is a good thing, generally. But the only thing that we've really seen that is customized for
this chip for Galaxy is a slightly higher max clock
speed on the performance core and slightly higher
clock speed on the GPU. So to be exact, 3.36GHz instead of 3.2 on the performance core and
719MHz versus 680 on the GPU. So yeah, it does score
slightly better on benchmarks than the regular Snapdragon
8 Gen 2, and that's nice for a little extra headroom
for high performance stuff, light gaming and for future-proofing, but that's not the whole story. There's two main things that matter here, one is efficiency gains. So, obviously performance is awesome, but because efficiency is better, these phones get some
serious battery life gains that we'll talk in a second. But also too, is bye-bye Exynos, because they're not making an
Exynos version of this phone as far as I can tell anywhere else. They're shipping every S23
Ultra with a Qualcomm chip, so everyone gets the efficiency and performance gains
from the Qualcomm version. So lemme tell you, the
battery life on this phone is actually, it's been incredible, like it's really, really good. So it's the 5,000 million power cell again shouldn't be a surprise,
but with this huge screen, I guess it kind of is actually a surprise. I had a two-day period at 120Hz but 1080P, where the only time I charged it was on the wireless charger in my car on the way to and from the studio for like the 40 minutes
that that drive is. I didn't charge it overnight
or anything like that. Two full packed days of high brightness, high intensity, normal use for me, has something like eight and a
half hours of screen-on time. I'm in bed at like 11:00 PM
at the end of the second day streaming on YouTube live watching LeBron break Kareem's record, it's still got like 10%
left, it just won't die. So combine this excellent battery life with a pretty solid 45 watt charging that can go zero to 100 in an
hour, plus wireless charging, and you've got yourself a
battery monster, it's super good. I don't think enough people are talking about how much better the battery got. Maybe someone will do one of
those crazy long runtime demos versus the past phone, but
yeah, it's really good, probably better than you think. You kind of don't ever
need to switch to 1080P to save batteries, matter of fact, when you take it out of the box, immediately just go in
and switch it to 1440P, 'cause you spent 1200 bucks on this phone, and it lasts forever, treat yourself. Okay anyway, that's the chips,
that's what that enables, but there's also a new set of cameras, hardware and software across the board that also is better than you think. Now, the fundamentals are mostly the same, which is why this
probably gets written off so quickly a lot. The layout, the aesthetics,
the focal lengths, the arrangement, it's
all practically the same, but we have a new
200-megapixel primary camera with double the optical image
stabilization range as before. That's hugely important. And then new sensors
across the ultra wide, the 3X telephoto, and the
10X periscope cameras. This new primary sensor setup though, I know we keep saying
cameras are mostly software, and as far as the look
and style of the photos, it absolutely still
is, but the improvement to the stabilization is so important here. So when you go from a normal sensor to a super-high resolution
200-megapixel sensor, the fact is, in these
tiny smartphone cameras, the individual pixels are
so small that individually, they physically can't
bring in that much light. So the camera does this
thing called binning, where it combines the information from a bunch of adjacent pixels to form larger more accurate
pixels in your image. So you're not shooting
200 megapixels by default, it's actually binning 16 pixels into one, so you end up taking a 12.5 megapixel shot for normal photos, but each photo is theoretically more
accurate thanks to its makeup. And then like I said, the
stabilization performance on this new primary camera has doubled. (phone rattles) Still rattles a little bit,
but that means it'll correct up to three degrees of shake
now versus the 1.5 from before, so here's an example of what's happening. If you get a lens with really good optical
image stabilization, (lens rattles) like this one, that means it can
correct from the movement in your hand much more, which means you can hold the
camera stable for much longer, so it can leave the shutter open to collect more light and
still get a sharp photo. So, all of this is to say
Galaxy S23 Ultra photos, most of the time, in most lighting, look pretty similar to last year. So if that's all you're looking at, just normal side by sides,
this is mostly gonna come down to the different software tuning, and there's a little bit more
dynamic range than last year, but yeah, still top of the line while mostly avoiding looking to HDR-y. Photos are typically pretty
warm from these Samsung phones, and they have a slightly punchier, more contrasty look than before, still very much up the Samsung alley of colorful and saturated,
but it's an aesthetic that I can get behind, I really like. But, on top of that,
having this new sensor and optical stabilization means one, you can shoot literally
200-megapixel photos now if you really want to. Now, this does accomplish
the intended purpose of capturing much more of the finer detail in things like landscapes, so if you plan on zooming
in on the shot later, or if you're one of the
three people on earth who will actually print
a smartphone photo, this should work, but
you should also be aware that it's only really able to give you these types of
results in excellent lighting where a ton of light is hitting every individual little pixel. Anything short of that, and you're gonna get a
lot of noise really quick. And there's also a
really solid shutter lag as it turns out these massive
40, 50 megabyte files, granted this mode is mostly
for things sitting still, like a landscape or a photo
shoot but worth noting. I think the better compromise is you actually also
get a 50-megapixel mode, which kicks out still very detailed images that hang right with the iPhone's
48-megapixel ProRAW shots in a variety of light, but now
the files are five megabytes, and there's a lot of less shutter lag. But there's still that improved detail over the normal binge shots
and not as much noise. It's all about flexibility. The standard mode is gonna be the best for most shots most of the time, but you can always turn
it up if you want to, and that's very much the
same thing with the zoom. You see all the cameras on the back. Any phone with two
different telephoto cameras is gonna have the biggest
range of good zoom performance. On this phone, anything past 10X is where it really shines
compared to others. And you might have even
seen my recent clip of taking a photo of
the full moon recently, which seems to blow people's
minds every time they see it. Wow, but you also can't
forget about video too. This is improved video across the board with better processing, the new sensors, and the much better stabilization,
thanks to the better OIS. So this might be the
best super steady mode I've ever seen in smartphone video, and the beauty of it being
from optical stabilization is it works great in
a variety of lighting, unlike some electronic
image stabilization, which relies on having a ton of light. And on top of all of that, the 8K video on this
smartphone is very usable. There are previous phones
that have had 8K video, it's not the first, but I remember when they
first got that capability, they'd always be at like 24 FPS, 'cause that's the most
that they could churn out, which is not the right frame
rate, so 8K/30 really good. And if you put it
side-by-side with the 4K, you can actually see
the sharpness difference if you really punch in. If you want a sample of this, the latest Auto Focus
video I shot in my car is in 8K from this phone, and you can actually go watch
it 8K on YouTube right now from the link below, hit that
like button if you want to. Oh yeah, and also, don't forget about the better selfies too. There's a new 12 megapixel selfie camera in all these S23 phones. And while that number is lower on paper than the 40 megapixel selfie camera that came before it, it's better. It's just better, rock solid proof that the megapixels don't matter. This selfie camera, with the
better software processing, is very sharp, detailed, has nice color, doesn't flare too much, and
also has a decently wide angle. It's not ultra-wide but not bad. So across the board, this is significant, an extensive improvement to the camera, especially the primary camera. That feels overlooked to me when people have been reviewing the phone. The one thing I still will complain about is there is still shutter lag, which is different from
slow shutter speed. So the time gap between
hitting the shutter button and actually capturing the
photo, it's still real, and it can still be kind of annoying, even if you capture a crisp
photo of the wrong moment. So, like I said, it's more pronounced when you take the ultra
high resolution 50-megapixel or 200-megapixel photos. You can't exactly do those in rapid fire. But if the question is, ""Did they make a meaningful improvement ""to last year's phone to end up here?"" I would say between the new chip and the better overall performance, and much better efficiency, which gets you huge
battery life improvement, and the new cameras
with the better sensors, better processing, but also
much better stabilization, I would say yes, not upgrade
from last year's phone, yes, but they've actually
made a real improvement. And then, I don't really need
to say too much about the rest because it's the same as before, which, in the case of the
best big phone of last year, is kind of a good thing. All the other things that
made this the best big phone are still here, and they're
not minor things either. I haven't even talked
about the A+ display, 1440P, 120Hz LTPO, 1,750
nits peak brightness, it's still awesome,
still has great speakers, still has very reliable software with a pretty good track record now of delivering software updates in a timely fashion for a while. The base storage has
also actually jumped up from 128 to 256 gigs, and it's
faster UFS 4.0 storage now. It still has the best stylus
in a smartphone in the world, which might mean a lot more
to you than it does to me, but, honestly, if I ever use it, it's nice knowing I can at any time mark up a screenshot or sign a PDF. And the list goes on, great haptic motor, nice clicky buttons, it's all still here. This thing sets the standard pretty high. My analogy that I was making is that it feels like the
portion 9/11 of smartphones. If you're gonna charge
1200 bucks for a phone, it better set high marks all
the way across the board, but it does, and it's pretty underrated, kind of boring, but it does. Now, if you want the S23 Ultra to look as improved as it actually is, I would recommend a skin from
channel sponsored, dbrand, maybe something like this Damascus skin, which adds a lot of character, where it would ordinarily be pretty blank. My favorite one is the Triple Black. It is actually included for free when you pick up any of
the holographic colorways, so you can check 'em
out at the link below. I say this phone is boring, and I think maybe understated
is the better word. Are there gonna be other
phones that come out this year that do one up this phone in
certain single categories? Yeah, 100%, there's probably gonna be a phone with 120X zoom. There's probably gonna be a
phone with crazy fast charging. This is only 45 watt charging.
Do I wish this was better? A little bit, sometimes. Is there gonna be a phone probably with a much bigger, better,
faster fingerprint reader? (soft bright music)
Yeah, probably. But as far as just nailing all
the marks across the board, yeah, this does it. Just as far as overall package, Samsung's software is settled,
the screen is sublime, it's still the sickest stylus, and it's snaps significantly
smoother shots, sick. Thanks for watching, catch you
guys in the next one, peace. (bright music continues)","Will it work good specially the camera !! As most of the android get worse after 2/3 year specially the camera.

3yEP4ooj1WI,OnePlus 11 Review: They&#39;re Back?!,OnePlus 11 is a flagship for $699 MKBHD Merch: http://shop.MKBHD.com OnePlus 11: https://geni.us/xJWn9XK Tech I'm using ...,2023-02-07T15:15:15Z,4138118,124731,7446,I was kind of wondering how long it would be before I could say this again if I'd ever say it again but OnePlus is kind of back so this is the new OnePlus 11. now people who have been following the industry for a little bit already know the story behind this phone which is OnePlus starting out hot as a fan favorite with a plus bang for the buck Flagship killer type of phones peaking I'd say around the OnePlus 7 Pro it's my phone of the year and then slowly descending into the very generic expensive Flagship that they swore to kill their last attempt at a phone the 10t is literally the worst phone that came out last year it won my bust of the year and I got a trophy for it and apparently they've used this as motivation they keep saying oh they now they want to redeem themselves now they're gonna turn it around and you know great like I think we all know the next phone was already in the works by the time they got that trophy but if you want to give me some credit I'll take some credit sure but the point is they're sort of reflecting shades of old OnePlus which is a really good thing because this phone is really good so this is a flagship smartphone right now for 6.99 in a world where the Galaxy s23 just came out it's 7.99 that's a sort of a de facto default for a lot of people my semi-hot take is this could be a better phone for a lot of people now it's not perfect and they still do some classic Corner cutting things to pull this off and there are still some software behaviors that I really do not like but here are the basics so if you want just a classic spec sheet bang for the buck summary this phone has a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 with 8 gigs of RAM a 6.7 inch 1440p 120 hertz OLED display triple cameras and a 5 000 milliamp hour battery with 80 watt charging for 699 bucks that's pretty damn good so I think because the phone has like the nice screen the big battery and the newest chip it begs comparisons to like the 900 000 other Flagship phones but like I said it does cut some Corners the big one being no wireless charging huge and then the other it's ip64 rated instead of IP67 so it'll survive a Mist better than a splash but on the design front I'd call this a mixed bag mixed bag you know it definitely is taking a step away from the ultra generic last generation the Hasselblad branding is back and we'll talk about the cameras in a minute but also the alert slider is back literally an iconic OnePlus feature that they somehow thought getting rid of last time was a good idea this one also has a very slightly textured matte black finish on the back not quite Sandstone level but enough to be interesting so I like it and the camera bump the camera bump is kind of a weird hybrid of smoothly wrapping around the side like Samsung used to but then turning it into a big circle Plateau that looks like a generic not seamless thing anymore at all it's whatever I don't mind it it's fine but you're not here for the back of the phone though like honestly if you just saw the back and saw the lack of wireless charging and a slightly awkward camera bump it feels like a 699 phone sure but the front is where it gets way more impressive 6.7 inch corner to corner thin bezel with a slight curve over the edges I wish it was flatter but it's not too bad 1440p resolution 120 hertz ltpo OLED 1000 Hertz touch sample rate and 1300 nits Peak brightness that's visible outdoors in all but direct sunlight and that little corner cut out for the selfie camera that's nearly as good as you can ask for these days and actually using a phone it's very Snappy and smooth it's got the fingerprint reader on the display in just the right spot it's fast and OnePlus One a little over the top with like the future proofing of the highest end fastest internals it's good details like this phone has not just Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6E but the brand new Wi-Fi 7 not just UF S3 but ufs 4.0 the fastest storage and not just LP ddr5 but LP ddr5x the fastest memory available so this is legitimately very Snappy and it's a quick phone brand new but then because of those high-end internals I do expect the Headroom to age pretty well the snap Dragon Age Gen 2 has proven to be a pretty good chip like the other phones that have had it so far have been really good phones and this is too it's a powerful chip and the GPU is great but also it's been pretty efficient and that's affecting the battery situation and I think for battery on this phone this is where it feels the most like old OnePlus so the OnePlus 11 has a 5 000 milliamp hour battery great battery life so if I if I use it like normal maxed out High brightness 1440p and 120 hertz on I'm making it to the end of the day fine no problem when I go 1080P and still 120 hertz I was able to get two days out of this phone matter of fact I'm on the second day right now it's almost noon I have 31 percent that's pretty good I'm getting to the end of two light days with like seven eight hours of screen on time fine that's really good and then for charging in the US this one has 80 watt charging I think in China other versions have 100 watt charging there's a difference in electrical standards but super fast charging so if I ever found myself thinking oh I need a little extra battery it's kind of low right now it was rare but I could plug in for a few minutes and have more than enough it is that Oppo supervook charging Tech so it's still the brick with USB a instead of USBC but hey at least it comes in the Box plus the cable so I know also having wireless charging would be really convenient and it's kind of annoying going from a phone that does have wireless charging to one that doesn't but I think OnePlus is counting on people who have other phones now that don't have wireless charging moving to this one and finding it's like an awesome battery experience so that's what they're counting on but let me talk about the cameras in this phone because these are also a throwback to Old OnePlus which if you remember those phones means not as good as the flagships but really solid so it's got that 50 megapixel main camera that bins down to 12 and a half megapixels and it gives me images that are generally pretty sharp and nice if you don't zoom in I mean I was pleasantly surprised that in most different types of shooting scenarios it was at least capable of giving me a solid shot even in low light when it does miss it tends to overexpose a bit and even more so with darker skin tones also focus is a little suspiciously slow sometimes so I found myself taking multiple shots of moving objects just to make sure I got a good one but you know what if the bar is being set at just a good enough camera that it's not a dead giveaway that it's a cheaper phone it clears that bar for sure I couldn't tell you how much that Hasselblad partnership is actually doing for photos here I mean color science maybe it seems like there's pretty balanced colors and nice Optical characteristics but like that's about all I can say about that I mean the photos look fine the ultrawide is definitely soft near the edges of the frame but at least it matches colors pretty well with the main and it does do macro when you get super up close to things but it's not good macro I mean it does the macro but yeah not great the only reason I'm not going to keep dailying this phone though aside from other phones that I have to test very soon is the software there's just some things that I I mean the software is fine lots of people use this software all over the world I have no problem with it there's so many little quirks and things that they just add up and they get annoying so here if you're going to be like old OnePlus One Plus let's have some feedback let's listen to some user feedback here so I'm an Android User who spends a lot of time in the notifications it's very important part of the phone a lot of other people spend a lot of time there too in every other Android phone that I've used when you have a notification you can swipe left or swipe right to clear them but for some reason on this phone you can only swipe away to the right if you swipe to the left no matter how fast your swipe is it pulls up settings and then you have to swipe again to clear so this is slightly annoying every single time and then in every other Android phone if I have multiple notifications from the same app then I can swipe down with one or two fingers to view each one and if I just want to open the app you click it or if you want to open a specific instance of that notification you can do that when it's expanded on this phone for some reason you can't swipe to expand the group of notifications you can only click it which expands it but then in the apps where there's a single notification and you want to expand it like a camera preview or a message preview or something with more information you can't just swipe like every other Android phone you have to tap this tiny bar at the top of the notification around that Arrow to view the preview that is even more annoying over time and then in every other Android phone if you pull down your notifications and you have a lot of them you can always go you know what never mind and then pull them all the way back up to close on this phone it takes multiple swipes to get through all your notifications and close them every time that's a little more annoying and then if you have music playing in the background say on Spotify or podcast or something you want to get to that app on every other phone it's a swipe and a Tap Away on this phone it's a swipe a tap and another tap to get to the app there's a bunch of little things like that from coming from almost any other Android phone that doesn't use color Os or this version of software and it would be fine if that's the default Behavior but there's at least a toggle to let me not have that happen every time but it happens every time but the good thing is other than that there's a lot of nice things like in this software it's very well thought out and laid out I think especially with the haptics and the combination of visual and haptic touches throughout it like pulling up and down the brightness slider you get this nice haptic feed feedback or going up and down in volume it's the same thing it very well thought out in that way so I think if OnePlus really wants to sort of redeem themselves and they look back a little bit at what was so successful with oxygen OS I know they eventually did this merge thing with Oppo and color OS but look at what people loved about oxygen OS and really think about bringing some of those things back okay so this one's competition at 6.99 it's kind of interesting I think today you'd probably consider buying a pixel 7 for 5.99 but what this phone will have over some of these other phones in this price range is some of the highest end specs the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and the 1440p display specifically it'll always have some of those spec things if you're interested in that there's even a 799 version that has 16 gigs of RAM and 256 gigs of storage too so yeah that's that's what feels like sort of classic Redemption OnePlus is this a full Redemption no I'm not going to give them full Redemption status yet uh but if the if the character Arc of OnePlus was kind of like this and then like like this it does feel like this is a inflection point it feels like this is a little bit of a shift in the right direction at least so now I just hope they keep it going you know if they might be past their Peak but their performance and price of this phone show potential thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace [Music],"Watching this in 2025 on my oneplus

cneoANZKBGk,M2 Pro Mac Mini Review: Game Changer!,This tiny computer out-benchmarks the base Mac Pro... and the price went down. M2 Max MacBook Pro Review: ...,2023-01-24T23:19:09Z,4292167,124636,3988,"(logo whirring) - Hey, what's up? MKBHD here. So this little machine,
this one right here, that I can hold in my hands, has more power than a
base Mac Pro right now, more CPU power anyway. Now, I hope that that's
not true for much longer, because the Mac Pro is overdue for its Apple Silicon upgrade. But the fact that it's
true at all right now is absolutely insane. This little machine is
not only super powerful, and super efficient, and super small, but it's also a really good price. So I said in my last video
about the MacBook Pros that the Mac mini is actually
the more interesting machine. And I mean it, it really is. It's just gotten a refresh from the M1 chip that it had before to now having an M2, and an M2 Pro option, both of which are kind of game
changers in their own ways. So first, the M2 version, the base M2 Mac mini is a game changer because it's all the benefits of the new Apple Silicon stuff, the second-generation,
five-nanometer process, the blazing fast shared memory, all the optimizations that come with it, for a starting price of $599, US. So I mean, it's a pretty simple computer, not even a small tower, just an absolutely tiny computer in there. It's basically the laptop, but without the screen and the keyboard, only one color, silver, and then a decent selection
of ports around the back, along with a small exhaust
vent for active cooling, and a headphone jack. And so this thing packs a surprisingly enormous
power for its size. We've seen this Apple
Silicon transition play out over the past two years. And when the Mac mini
moved to Apple Silicon from the Intel chips, it took an absolutely hilarious
leap up in performance. Some of the numbers on
paper are just ridiculous. You have to forgive me for using Apple's stupid unlabeled charts, but like, just to give you an idea, this completely changed
the nature of the product. So this M1 Mac mini is
already dramatically better than the Intel one for 99% of people. And now the M2 comes
along with more cores, a more powerful CPU and
GPU, more max memory, and a higher overall performance ceiling, and the price goes down from $699 to $599. Apple almost never lowers the price of the entry level of anything, but that's exactly what's happened here. So we just got a computer
that's more powerful, and more capable, and more
efficient for less money. And so then we also have
the M2 Pro Mac mini. This is the one that I've
been testing and using. And so before, we just had the base Apple Silicon M1
Mac mini, now that's the M2, but we've also now got this Pro chip, which raises the ceiling
for Mac mini performance, still on the same tiny body. Well, actually, I can't say
the exact same tiny body, because the M2 Pro version also does gain two more Thunderbolt ports. So now there's four Thunderbolt
four ports on the back along with everything else still here. And that means you can now
do three external displays instead of two, and you can still option
up to 10 gigabit ethernet if you're blessed with that
type of internet connection, or if you're at an institution
that will take advantage of the networking capability. And yes, that is HDMI 2.1. But the big deal here with
this new chip is the M2 Pro is so much more performant thanks to the updated
architecture, and the extra cores, that it's now benchmarking
actually over the M1 Pro and the M1 Max in the CPU department that was in the highest
end MacBook Pros before. I had to double take
when I first read that, because M1 Max has been so incredible, but yet here we are, even the incremental
improvements here are notable. And on top of that, the thermal advantage
potentially of a Mac mini with active cooling in a taller
chassis over a MacBook Pro can also mean in the long term, you know, sustained CPU performance over time. You may see even better results there. So this thing's performance is rock-solid. And then, of course, as you
move up in chips from base to Pro to Max, that's actually
mostly a GPU improvement. And so M2 Pro does great here, too, but as you can see, the results
fall sort of more in line. It's improvement, of
course, over the last one, but the Max chips are still the way to go if your applications specifically take advantage of GPU power. But then everyday performance is just, it's gonna be the same,
which is to say, great. But the sustained multi-core
performance ceiling is just way higher. You know, especially for
things like video editing, or app development, things that have basically
longer compiled times or render times that might be above what
you wanna do on the base M2, that's awesome on the M2 Pro. This model starts at $1299. Not cheap, of course, but when you consider
the M2 Pro MacBook Pro with the exact same system on a chip starts at $1999 right now, pretty good. That's actually, that's the real reason I'm calling these Mac
minis a game changer, or at least for being so good,
is performance per dollar. You don't usually expect
that out of a Mac, but if I were to do like, one
of those dumb Apple charts of like, here's the laptops
performance per dollar, and then here's the Mac mini's, which is the same performance, but for less money, it's
better, the line's higher. You know, for so long Apple's
prioritized these laptops, which makes perfect sense, by the way. They've been great,
lots of people buy them. But some people get the laptop, and then just keep it
in one room all the time because desktop options
aren't as appealing. And if we're being
honest, the iMac is cool, but it's not for everyone. Like even right now, it kind of feels like Apple
low-key forgot about the iMac. It's just been sitting with the unupgraded M1 chip
for a little while now, even when M2 is out, but
then they dropped Mac Studio. And Mac Studio is excellent in the highest end configurations, and I can't wait for the M2 Ultra here. But yeah, the Mac mini now slots in really nicely underneath all of that. And, of course, with the
modularity of a desktop that doesn't come with a monitor built in, now you pick whatever display you want with the $700 you save. It's funny, in recent reviews, I've been trying to give
sustainability notes where it's relevant. And so there are some neat
ones with this machine like recycled aluminum, the
the packaging on the outside, the recycled plastics on
the inside of the Mac, all that's cool, but all of
that sort of is outweighed by the ability to continue
using your same display, and swap out displays however
you want, unlike the iMac. Call me crazy, but I think
there's a lot of people who probably don't wanna be stuck with a non-upgradable display and webcam and white bezels forever. Plus, if you already
have a display you like, yeah, you can just continue using that. I haven't done a video on the Mac mini since the ""Fastest Mac
Mini in the World"" project that I did back in college. Shout out to those of you
who subscribed back then. But I basically, I took the highest-end
available Mac mini in 2012, and maxed it out by
upgrading to the fastest RAM, the fastest SSD it would support, in an effort to make it like,
the most capable tiny machine for a college dorm room
where space is at a premium. Because, clearly, my
priorities at the time were video editing over homework. Now, this M2 Pro Mac mini has all the power that I
would've killed for back then as a fledgling creator
with not a lot of space, and it costs less. It costs less. I had to look back. I had spent in total with
the Mac and all the upgrades, $1,759 for the fastest
Mac mini in the world. This one blows it out the
water as far as performance and capability. Of course, the difference here is no part of this
tightly-integrated machine is upgradable at all. So now you gotta think about
spending a little bit more to account for having the
machine for a long time and not upgrading things. Maybe a little more RAM,
maybe a little more storage. Depends on what you're doing with it. But yeah, this would have
blown out the water... This can handle basically any footage that I could possibly throw at
it that I could shoot myself. Also, by the way, if you actually do happen to
be looking at one of these and you are in college
like I was back then, don't forget about the student discount. That's typically a hundred bucks off. And I think with these
machines it's a hundred bucks. So now that brings this down a hundred. That also brings the base M2
down to $499, which is great. So in conclusion, if you're
trying to think of... If you're trying to pick
one Mac to buy right now, think of it this way. If you already have an Apple Silicon Mac, like an M1 generation Mac, you're good. You don't have to buy
a new Mac every year. Those machines were a great
update over the Intel ones. You're set. Now, if you have an older machine, and you're actually looking to upgrade, I would actually default to the Mac mini, and just start with the
base M2 $599 Mac mini. And I would not buy the iMac right now, because if you look at
the specs specifically, it's still M1, and it's $1299 for a
non-removable 24-inch display. I would just get the Mac mini instead, and get whatever $600 screen you want. You can swap that out however. So I wouldn't recommend iMac right now. And then if you know that you specifically wanna
be computing on the go, that's when you move over, okay, okay, the laptops are really good. You can get an M2-generation MacBook Pro, and those are excellent. I just reviewed them. If you wanna check it out, link's below the like
button, that video's up, and that's how I think about the lineup. But honestly, if you can find an M1-generation
MacBook Pro right now on a discount, that's really good, too. And then within each lineup,
of course, I keep saying this, but the big difference
between M2, M2 Pro, M2 Max, and eventually M2 Ultra when
when it comes out, is GPU. So it shouldn't be a shock that they're all sort of
similar in CPU performance. But if the applications that you use, and you know your workflow will
take advantage of GPU power, then that's when you bump that up. Okay, yeah, that's pretty much it. Maybe a little bit shocking, but yeah, price for performance, Mac
mini, kind of a huge winner. Mac mini might make me
miss removable memory, but it makes most massive
media machines feel pretty mid. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys the next one. Peace. (soft music)","Watching this after the M4 mini. Just the design with the ports and the power button on the back was so much better. That is really apple. More powerful worse design | Your thumbnail is extremely funny. Mac Gigantic. ^^

Also, it's impressive that the Mac Mini had so much power. | Woo | him face for less money, LMFAO 😂😂😂😂😂 2:17 | If me and my partner ever move in together and think we need a general home desktop, am definitely getting this. | M4 is tempting everybody--at this very moment ! | So ... this would be PERFECT for final cut pro, to edit and RENDER quickly, 5.7K  pro res / MOV / Mp4  files ???

tmGDx9hVWwo,M2 Max MacBook Pro Review: Back to Bumps!,It's an (impressive) bump instead of a quantum leap. MKBHD Merch: http://shop.MKBHD.com Get a dbrand skin for your MacBook ...,2023-01-23T14:01:39Z,5072646,161193,5404,"(upbeat music) (upbeat music continues) - So this is the M2 Max MacBook Pro. Let's talk about it. So this week, Apple updated the 14 inch and 16 inch MacBook Pros
with a press release and an 18 minute YouTube video that featured a bunch of
creators at the beginning, which was cool, and then basically
a whole prerecorded event that kind of looked like it
was cut out of another event. Matter of fact, it's rumored that this basically was cut out of an event that they were rumored
to have late last year. Honestly, I buy it, like the URL and the file name
of the video had 2022 in them and the AR files for the new laptops were compiled in October, 2022, suggesting that these things
were ready to go months ago. But whatever, none of that matters. What matters is they're here now and what you need to
know is on the outside, they're basically identical, but on the inside, instead
of M1 Pro and M1 Max, it's M2 Pro and M2 Max, and a couple other tiny improvements also. So the first Apple Silicon MacBook Pros, when they came out in October, 2021, honestly some of the most
unanimously well-liked computers I have ever seen. They added back the ports,
they got rid of the touch bar, they brought back MagSafe, they bumped up to an excellent high refresh
rate mini LED display, and the performance is incredible. Like across the board, I don't think I've met a
single person who got one and was like, ""Oh, nah, I
made a mistake with this one."" So when you see a new one
a year and a half later, there isn't really a ton that
we're expecting to change because the big leap was
from the Intel MacBook Pros to the Apple Silicon ones. Now we're back to more
incremental improvements. So as you can imagine, yeah, completely identical on the outside, same sizes, same colors, the only way I can
differentiate this new one from my old 16 inch M1 Max is the icon skin I've had on the back. Of course, channel sponsor dbrand is already selling these
for the 2023 model, so if you want your laptop
to look a little different than every other MacBook Pro in the world, then, yeah, this is your
best bet, link below. So the bulk of what's new is coming from the new chip inside. M2 Pro and M2 Max. They are essentially the same price tiers and configurations across
the board as before but Apple is quoting now
20% more CPU performance and 30% better GPU performance. This in front of me here is a maxed out M2 Max with the 38 core GPU and the new maximum of
96 gigs of shared memory. Shocker, this thing rips. So under the hood, it's built on a new second gen 5 nanometer process, and they've added some cores, two more high efficiency CPU cores and three more GPU cores on the Pro, so it's a 19 core GPU on the M2 Pro. And a 38 core GPU on the M2 Max. Also, the neural engine and media engine are improved to handle machine learning and media playback and transcoding even faster than they already did. If you're into synthetic benchmarks, I did run Geekbench 5 and the single core score is now the highest I have
ever seen, just over 2,000, while the multi-core
score was north of 15,000. Here's some context to give you an idea of how impressive these numbers are. And yes, that is about the 20% CPU improvement that we expected. And then, in Cinebench, again, it had a chart topping single core score and here's how the multi-core stacks out. So overall capabilities, basically the ceiling has been raised up by the 20 to 30%, which is
great, but as I mentioned in the original M1 Max
review a year and a half ago, it's not so much about
the raw processing power as much as it's about the things that it allows you to do
better or faster than before, hence the name Pro, theoretically. So like I noticed this in things where I have parts of my workflow that work just right with it. So I have this same I do where I screen record with ScreenFlow and it'll do a full
resolution screen recording and then I'll export that and use it and bring into Final Cut Pro. The exporting of that screen recording into ProRes 422 was dramatically improved when we got the media
engine with Apple Silicon. So a 16 core Intel Mac Pro with a Vega Pro II Duo that retailed for over $15,000, took a three and a half
minute screen recording and churned that out in 56 seconds. But the M1 max laptop
did it in 32 seconds, So that was so sick, that's one of those things you instantly notice is way faster. This new M2 Max did it in 23 seconds. So again, a pretty
substantial improvement. Like, clearly the outgoing
machines weren't lacking but they've taken basically
everything that was good about the old ones and improved it, just bumped it up a little
bit, which is sweet. For everyday daily non-demanding tasks as you can probably imagine, these are still great, totally great. Like, I've already told you all about the excellent mini LED display that has a questionable
amount of light bleed but still looks pretty
great most of the time. I've already told you
about the top-notch design and all of the metal build quality, the huge track pad, the
high quality headphone jack, the return of the built-in SD card slot, I've already told you about all that, but what about those
other tiny improvements I mentioned earlier
that aren't the M2 chip? Well, there's a couple things. So first of all, the
extra efficiency cores that I mentioned earlier are great, of course, for battery life. Not only is the battery
life still really good but there's also a claimed extra hour on both the 14 inch
and 16 inch of battery. I'm not seeing a dramatic difference, but, hey, the fact that it's
better at all, it's sick. And then these laptops still fast charge but there's also now a color
matching MagSafe cable. Now this is a slight difference since these laptops are really only silver or slightly darker
silver, but there you go, it's darker now with a
space gray one, it matches, color matching all the way up until the white plastic
USB-C nub on the other end. And then there's a few other capabilities WiFI 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, and HDMI 2.1. So HDMI 2.1 was actually something I was confused about
missing on the last version since it had been out for a little bit. But it's now here and that allows for up to 8K 60FPSs through one
cable via the HDMI port. So that's about time. WiFi 6E is just sort of
starting to roll out now, that's gonna be great for future proofing. We literally just got WiFi
6E routers in the studio for the first time and the MacBook Pros have consistently been
like the fastest thing on our wifi network, and it continues to stretch
that lead in that department. And Bluetooth 5.3, again, very much future proofing,
but that's welcome. But really the Apple Silicon
transition has come a long way since the very first M1 Max that we saw when they first started doing this. There are a lot more well optimized apps, it's a lot more obvious
what the benefits are. It's still not complete, of course, because we don't have a Mac Pro yet, and also it kind of feels like
they forgot about the iMac. That's just chilling, still
stuck at M1, for some reason. But really, yeah, these are
a level up from the rest. And I think my overall
recommendations about what to buy at certain spots in the lineup
basically stays the same. So if you're after battery life, M2 Pro is gonna be awesome, if you're after maximum power at the expense of some
of your battery life, then M2 Max is probably the move. And really my pretty
textbook conclusion here is these laptops aren't for people who already have the M1
Pro and M1 Max laptops that just came out, they are for people who have older laptops that now have a better
machine to upgrade to, unless you're one of a
tiny fraction of people who got the old ones and was pushing it to its limits and just needs that 30% more power, in which case, you know who you are. Matter of fact, for those
people on older laptops, I think looking for sales now of the M1 Pro and M1 Max, when you start to find deals on those, those are gonna be really good laptops. Now, you might have also seen the rumors that it's possible that
the first of the M3 laptops is gonna be coming out
later this calendar year on a three nanometer process, and you might be wondering
if you should wait for that. To which I would say,
you should actually wait till quarter three of
2027 when we have the M5s because that'll be 30% faster than the M4s which is 30% faster than the M3s, and you can see where I'm going with this. Like, if you're gonna be
waiting for the next thing, you'll just be waiting forever 'cause that's just the way tech is. These are great machines, they're more than most people need, and if you can get your hands on the M1s, those are gonna be really
good for most people too. Either way, make sure you get subscribed because I think, I think actually the new M2 Mac Minis are a way more interesting machine, so stay tuned for that video. Also, I said something
in in my last review. With that being said, if the next version of this laptop still has a notch this big
and doesn't add Face ID, I'll wear socks and sandals
for a day, like Linus. Like, they gotta be planning on putting it there eventually, right? Well, all day today, I'm a man of my word. Thanks for watching, catch you guys in the next one, peace.

1xiqOg1NRPA,This Phone is $169 - What&#39;s the Catch?,Brand new budget phone vs older flagship phone? Moto G Play: https://geni.us/ROuPcTc MKBHD Merch: http://shop.MKBHD.com ...,2023-01-12T16:00:58Z,4029839,123758,8009,"(Intro sounds) - This brand new smartphone from 2023 has a 6 1/2-inch, 90 hertz
display with a hole-punch cutout, a 5,000 milliamp-hour
battery, triple cameras, a micro SD card slot
for expandable storage, a headphone jack, and
water resistance for 169. Nice, but what's the catch? There's gotta be a catch, right? So look, I've said it before
and I'll say it again. Good phones are getting cheap, nuh, and cheap phones are getting good. And this video is gonna focus
on the second part of that, which is the cheap phones
that are getting so good, because this phone hit my inbox recently. It's called the Moto G Play
for 2023 and if you've been paying attention to what
Motorola's been doing recently, they've been making a lot
of really good budget phones in the background for
the past couple years. I just wanted to know,
personally, from using it myself, how do you end up at a phone
that's a 10th of the price of the ones that I've
been really enjoying? So on the outside, well,
it's a pretty big phone, which I like, and there's
actually a 6.5 inch flat 90 hertz LCD display. Now it's not the best-looking
screen you've ever seen. It's only 720P, so I can
literally see pixels sometimes, and it doesn't get very bright, you know, viewing angles are pretty
bad if you get off axis. And of course, the bezels you can see are slightly thicker,
especially in the chin. And there's this little
bit of light fall off around the hole-punch camera at the top. But the thing is, can you
really pixel peep at this price? Like this is plenty of screen for texting, web browsing, navigation,
flipping through apps, scrolling through social media, the classic stuff you wanna do on a phone. Mission accomplished, you
know, it's a big screen, so that's not the catch. But what about the build? You've probably picked up
that it's a pretty big phone but it's also made of plastic. But honestly, the layout
is perfectly fine. Like you've got the port and
the speakers at the bottom, there's a headphone jack at the top, and you have bonus expandable storage alongside the SIM card tray
right where it belongs. And on the back, yes, that is
a decently-fast fingerprint reader right in that classic
Motorola dimple spot. So it's laid out well, it
absolutely does not bend or creep or anything weird like that. Plus you might have heard
plastic is absolutely not the end of the world when it comes
to a smartphone build. Obviously the premium ones
will really like to feel more premium and heavy
and so glass will do that. But this is often more durable
than glass if you drop it. And some people like
a lighter-weight phone when it is this big. Also, it is still water resistant. I can't say waterproof, it's IP52, but it's water resistant. So the build, that's not the catch. So, okay, what about the battery, you might be wondering,
Cheap phone, it's excellent, perfectly unironically not
exaggerating, it's excellent, which actually shouldn't be
a surprise given the spec. It's a 5,000 milliamp-hour battery powering a phone with a 720p display. So you're good for a day and
a half easy, two light days is no problem with seven
hours of screen on time. Now it's only up to 10 watt charging, which is pretty slow and
there is no wireless charging, but I'm not gonna consider
that a gotcha at this price. Again, it's like you can just charge it up overnight every night like a normal person and
battery life will be fine. And even the software is really good. It's virtually the same experience as their $1000 flagship
Edge phone, which is to say, near stock Android with a little Moto extra features sprinkled on top. So at its most basic, it'll kind of feel like a Pixel when you dig
through like quick settings and notifications and the launcher, but then you get some Motorola
widgets tucked in, you know, you get a couple extra
settings in the settings app, but then you get this
Moto app that lets you dig into your extra gestures and features that they've perfected over the years. The double chop for the flashlight, the three finger screenshot,
you know, the peek display feature that gives you a peek
at your new notifications and even swiping down on
your notification panel from the fingerprint reader on the back. Basically, everything
minus the double twist to quickly open the camera,
probably because the camera is not one of those things that
you really look forward to on these super cheap phones. Oh wow, look at the light
fall off, you can see it on camera, but either
way, I'm happy to report that this camera is
functional, which is like, that's what you would
hope for at this price, which is, yeah, it's functional. I'm just not a huge fan of
the triple camera layout here. Like I know they're trying to look premium and triple cameras looks
premium, but the top one is a two-megapixel macro
camera and the bottom one is a two-megapixel depth
camera for portrait mode. So I'm mainly just looking for
this main 16-megapixel camera to be able to capture
scenes, documents, you know, take photos and videos without problems. And it does, especially if
you give it enough light. It's not gonna win any comparison
tests, that's for sure. But hey, we ask a lot of
our phones, like the fact that this $169 gadget can
already make phone calls and send text messages and
navigate you around the world and also play games
and also browse the web and it can also take decent pictures and 1080p videos and that's solid. I initially had my suspicions
about whether or not it was going to actually
use this depth camera when I take a portrait-mode
photo, but it did yell at me when I covered it and tried
to take a portrait-mode shot, so it's paying attention to it, at least. But when I took the photo and
turned up the background blur, this is the cutout shape
which, if you zoom in just a little bit, is truly bizarre. It's really bad. I've never seen anything
this bad in my life. (chuckles) They really just
said, ""Yeah, we'll just save a little processing power
here and use the zigzag cutout method from those scissors from preschool to make this work."" But see, that's the thing. That is the catch. It's not the build quality, that's fine, and it's definitely not the
battery life, that's great. It's not the cameras and it's
certainly not the software. It's that this phone is slow, really slow. So this phone has a MediaTek
Helio G37 chip inside and three gigabytes of RAM. Other phones with this chip
set include the Techno Spark 9, the Infinix Hot 12, and the HONOR X7a, all of which retail well under $150 US. So clearly it's a cheap chip, right, and that's how it ended up in this phone. For some context, the Geekbench score of the iPhone 14 is this,
and the Geekbench score of the Moto G Play is this. So when I say it's trying
to save processing power by not really doing
detailed portrait cutouts, I actually mean that,
like it absolutely lacks any meaningful processing power. And I'm not nitpicking about like maybe it's just slow on some
high-end games or something. No, this phone is slow all the time. It's slow to scroll and just
like move around the UI. Now remember I mentioned at the beginning that this phone has a
variable 90 hertz display but I'll be honest, it would've
taken me a while to tell because it is almost never
anywhere near 60 hertz. It's constantly hanging up
and stuttering everywhere. It's slow to unlock,
it's slow to open apps, not not just huge apps, just normal apps. Even the settings apps takes
an embarrassingly long time to open and even longer
to search through things. Some of this is like speed of
storage as well, to be fair. So I don't wanna put it all on the chip, but like the point here is
it's absolutely the catch. This phone is slower than
average to take pictures. It's slow to type stuff, to browse around, and just to do anything
like high-end gaming or photo editing is kind
of out of the question. It might be the slowest
phone I've ever used and I'm constantly reminded of it, which can make it quite unpleasant to use. So the longer I use this
phone, the more it had me thinking about one big question, which is, is it better to get a brand
new cheap phone like this or an older, formerly
expensive flagship one. Like this phone, this
is 169 brand new, right? This phone here, this
is the OnePlus 7 Pro, you might remember it. It's one of my favorite phones ever. This was the phone of the year in 2019. So this was 669 back when it
came out, but it can be had easily for well under
$200 right now secondhand. So this is just one example
of a phone like this. This phone, if you
compare dollar for dollar with the Moto is just so
much better of an experience across the board, obviously it'll have a much better chip set. So the Snapdragon 855 is a few years old, but it's much more capable and
part of an overall smoother, better performance profile with
faster storage and more RAM. It has a much, much nicer OLED screen, which is sharper,
brighter, and actually hits the 90 hertz refresh rate all the time. It has way more built-in
storage, although it's not expandable, and it has a
much better set of cameras. It's a primary plus an
ultra wide and a zoom, and it's built from
glass instead of plastic, which feels rock solid, and
it has a 4,000 milliamp hour battery, which is probably
the only hardware line you can call it a draw or maybe even a win for the Moto phone, but we
can't forget that warp charging that OnePlus was famous for. So this old flagship will do
30 watts of wired charging. So it's seeming pretty unanimous here. But one distinct advantage
of the budget phone is because it's new, it
will get software updates further into the future
than the old phone. Now this is theoretically, of
course, like Motorola does not have the best track record here, so it depends on what
phone we're talking about, but the Samsung A14 5G, for
example, has a pretty similar spec sheet and a similar price
point, and that'll probably get more software updates than the Moto. But the idea here is
even if a flagship phone is promised three to four
years of software updates, and the budget phone is only
getting two, as soon as that flagship phone is more
than about three years old, it doesn't have that advantage anymore. So the OnePlus 7 Pro
is probably about done with software updates
while we probably have a few in the tank for the Moto. It is also funny though,
sometimes, how I hear people talk about software updates,
like some people don't think about software updates at all,
they avoid software updates. Don't do that, by the way; the security patches are
actually pretty important. But yeah, it's just one of those points that has to, by default,
go to the newer phone. But the final straw in
favor of the older phone is actually the environment. Just because buying an older
phone that's built to last and getting an extra 2, 3, 4
years out of it potentially is better for the environment overall. You buy less new things,
it's less e-waste. So that's something that's
a feather in the cap of the old phone over the new one. So my general thought as
I've looked at this landscape and all these options with old flagships versus new budget phones is the lower the price of the
phone, the more I would actually want to buy the older phone. So at 169, for example, based
on the experience I've had with this phone, I would
definitely rather have, actually, the older flagship phone. There's a lot of flagships you
can get at about 200 bucks, you could get this one,
you could get a Pixel 5. Secondhand phones are really good. Now if you go up to like 400 bucks, then it's a little more debatable. There's still some things
that would still point me towards the formerly flagship
phone, but then you get to like 600 bucks and it's
like, oh, there's really good brand new $600 phones
that I would take today and still have the advantages
of the software updates. It's not a lot that's better
than the Pixel 7, right now. So that's the theory.
(brass fanfare blaring) So there you have it. At this price point, I'd
prefer prehistoric premium over presently pleasantly priced. Thanks for watching. Talk to you guys in the next one, peace. (brassy music continues) Pleasantly presently, that's a lot. Pleasantly, presently, pleasantly priced?","Verdict: An older flagship is the ticket. Thanks, young brotha! | This issue for me to purchase an old phone is can you trust where it’s coming from. | I just got my that's phone | the g play 2024 is leagues better and only a year after this one | wow | chin tho | motorolla e14 is only £69 | I wish i had some money to get that phone | this was the worst phone i ever owned bruh | All you need is the iobit app to speed up & smart manage the rams + virtual ram expansion (about 32 gb on a micro SD card)

88kd9tVwkH8,What is Happening with iPhone Camera?,What exactly is happening with the iPhone's camera? The Blind Smartphone Camera Test: https://youtu.be/LQdjmGimh04 ...,2023-01-05T22:22:55Z,5950927,205148,8333,"(Intro SFX) - Okay, what exactly is happening
with the iPhone's camera? Like we've done years of
blind smartphone camera tests in bracket format and the iPhone, supposedly one of the premium cameras in the entire smartphone industry, consistently loses in the first round. Then we do a scientific
version with 20 million+ votes and it finishes in the middle of the pack. ""And yet, Marques, you named
it the fourth-time running best overall smartphone
camera system in 2022 and gave it a trophy. What's up with that?"" A concerning amount of people have started to notice that the iPhones camera feels like it's taken
a few steps back lately and I agree with them. I think we should take
a closer look at this. (relaxed music) So first of all, cameras
have come a really long way to the point where smartphone cameras aren't just cameras anymore. See, back in the day, a
camera was basically a sensor that would travel around
covered all the time and when you wanted to take a photo, you would expose that sensitive bit to the environment around it and it would collect
the light and close it. Then the photo would be a representation of how much light hit
each part of the sensor. The better the sensor, the
better an image you could get, the more light information, super simple. These days though, it's turned into a whole
computational event. Your smartphone sensor is
sampling the environment, not once, but often several times in rapid succession at different speeds. It's taking that light information, merging exposures together. It's doing tone mapping, noise
reduction, HDR processing and putting it all together into what it thinks will
be the best looking image. This, of course, is a very different
definition of a picture. So now it's not just about
having the best sensor that gathers the most light information, it's at the point where software makes a much bigger difference to the way the image looks
at the end of the day than anything else. Like next time you watch a smartphone reveal event, for example, keep an eye on all the new
additions that get made and just how many of
them are pure software. So Google basically struck
gold when they first started using the IMX363 sensor way back in the day with
the Pixel 3's camera because they got their software
tuning with it just right and it was an instant smash hit. So they kept using that great camera combo in every Pixel since then. The 3, the 3a, the 4, the 4a, the 5, the 5a, and even the Pixel 6a. So year after year of new phones, same sensor, same software tuning combo because it just worked. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. So when you saw the Pixel 6a win December's scientific
blind smartphone camera test, what you saw was a four-year-old sensor and software tuning combo
that is still so good that in a postage-stamp-sized comparison of compressed side-by-side images where you can't really judge sharpness or depth of field too much, basically just appreciating the basics, this combo absolutely nailed the basics better than anyone else. Now, when the Pixel 6
came along, stay with me, Google finally updated their
design and their branding and they finally changed to a new sensor with this new camera system. So they go from the
tried-and-true 12 megapixel to this massive new 50 megapixel sensor and it kind of threw a wrench into things. - So it looks to me that the
Pixel is over sharpening. I think the one on the
left looks too crunchy. - The camera on the
Pixel 6 does have a habit of making things just look HDR-y. I dunno if there's really
a technical term for that. - [Dan] And if you look at all the photos, it's clear the Pixel is
still doing Pixel things. - I think Google's still running all of their camera algorithms at 11, like when they don't need to anymore. - Right now, new phones
with much bigger sensors are still processing like
their smaller older ones. - The basic principle is: they were doing all this
processing with the old sensors as if they were not getting a lot of light and then suddenly they had
this massive new sensor which is getting way
more light information but they were still running
all of this processing. They would still do high-sensitivity stuff and then they'd do noise reduction because if you have high sensitivity, you need noise reduction. But then since you're
doing noise reduction, you need to do sharpening on top of that to make up for it and just overall you're
doing way too much. And so the photos are
literally overprocessed. So this fancy new phone would come out with a new camera system, but you could argue, legitimately, that the older Pixel still
took better looking photos. So Google had to work really
hard at the drawing board and make some adjustments and
some updates to the software to dial in this new sensor. It took a while, but
now with the Pixel 7 out a full year later with the
same huge 50 megapixel sensor, they're back on track. And hey would you look at that, Pixel 7 right behind the Pixel
6a in the blind camera test. So when I see iPhone 14 Pro photos looking a little inconsistent and a little overprocessed right now, I actually see a lot of the same stuff that Google just went
through with the Pixel. Because the iPhone story is
kind of along the same lines, they used a small 12 megapixel sensor for years and years and years. Then the 13 Pro sensor got a little bigger but this year, the iPhone 14 Pro is the first time they're bumping up to this dramatically
larger 48 megapixel sensor. And so guess what? Some iPhone photos this year are looking a little too processed and it's nothing extreme, but it's real and they will have to work on this. I suspect that by the time we get to iPhone 15 Pro, you know, a year later, they'll have some new software
stuff they're working on. And I bet there's one new
word they use on stage. You know, we finally have Deep Fusion and pixel-binning and all this stuff, I bet there's one new word they use to explain some software
improvement with the camera. But anyway, I think this
will continue improving with software updates over time and they'll continue to get it dialed and I think it'll be fine. But that's only half my theory. This does not explain why all the previous 12 megapixel iPhones also all lost in the first round in all those other bracket style tests. And this is a separate issue that I'm actually a
little more curious about because as you might recall, all of our testing photos
have been photos of me. Now, this was on purpose, right? Like we specifically designed the tests to have as many potential factors to judge a photo as possible. Like if it was just a
picture of this figurine in front of a white wall, the winner would probably just
be whichever one's brighter, maybe whichever one has a
better gold color, basically. But then if we take the figurine with some falloff in the background now we're judging both
color and background blur. Maybe you add a sky to the background, now you're also testing
dynamic range and HDR. So yeah, with our latest
photo, it's a lot. It's two different skin tones. It's two different colored shirts. It's some textures for sharpness, the sky back there for a dynamic range, short-range falloff on the left, long-range falloff on the right. I mean with all these factors, whichever one people pick as a winner ideally is closer to
the best overall photo. I also wanted the
pictures to be of a human just because I feel like most of the important
pictures that people take, most often, that they care
about are of other humans. But as it turns out, using my own face as a subject for these revealed a lot about how
different smartphones handle taking a picture of a human face. Because as I've already mentioned, these smartphone cameras
are so much software now that the photo that you get
when you hit that shutter button isn't so much reality as much as it is this
computer's best interpretation of what it thinks you
want reality to look like. And each company goes to a different level of making different choices
and different optimizations to change their pictures
up to look different ways. They used to actually be a
little more transparent about it. There are phones that
would literally identify when you're taking a landscape photo and they'd pump up any greens
they can find of the grass or they'd identify any
picture with a sky in it and pump up the blues
to make it look nicer. I did a whole video on
smartphone cameras versus reality that I'll link below the Like button if you wanna check it out. But the point is, when you
snap that photo on your phone, you're not necessarily
getting back a capture of what was really in front of you. They're really bending it in many ways. The iPhone's thing is
when you take a photo it likes to identify faces
and evenly light them. It tries every time. And so this feels like a
pretty innocent thing, right? Like if you ask people normally, ""What do you think should
look good in a photo?"" And you say, ""Oh, I'll evenly
light all the faces in it."" That sounds fine, right? And a lot of time it looks fine but it's a subtle thing like in a photo where you can see the light is
coming from one side clearly, where you can see from the Pixel's camera, there's a shadow on the
right side of the face. With the iPhone though, it's almost like someone walked up and added a little bounce fill, (chuckles) just a really nice little
subtle bounce fill. But sometimes it looks a little off. Like look, this is the
low-light photo test we did from our blind camera test. On the left is the Pixel 7 again, which looks like all the other top dogs. And on the right is the iPhone 14 Pro that finished in the middle of the pack. It might be hard at first
to see why it looks so weird but look at how they
completely removed the shadow from half of my face. I am clearly being lit from a source that's to the side of me, and that's part of reality. But in the iPhone's
reality, you cannot tell, at least from my face, where
the light is coming from. Every once in a while you
get weird stuff like this. And it all comes back to the fact that it's software making choices. And the other half of that is skin tones. So you've heard me say
for a few years in a row that I mostly prefer photos
coming from the Pixel's camera, and we've done lots of tests where I have me as a sample photo and you can tell it looks really good. Turns out Google's done this
thing over the past few years with the Pixel camera called Real Tone. It doesn't get that much attention, but it turns out to be making
a pretty big difference here. Historically, a real issue for
film cameras back in the day was that they were calibrated
for lighter skin tones and people with darker skin tones would typically be
underexposed in those pictures. So now fast forward today,
cameras are all software. Smartphone cameras are software so they can all make adjustments to account for different variety
of skin tones, of course. But they still all do it to
different varying degrees. Like you might have noticed a lot of phones sold in China will just brighten up
faces across the board because that's what people prefer in photos in that region very often. Google goes the extra mile to train their camera
software on data sets that have a large variety of skin tones to try to represent them
correctly across the board. And that's what it's calling Real Tone. And Apple's cameras,
from what I've observed, simply just like to evenly
light faces across the board and doesn't necessarily account for different white balances
and exposures necessary to accurately represent
different types of skin tones when I think they totally could. So basically, it turns
out this is a big part of what we were observing in Pixel's and a lot of the phones that do accurately represent my skin tone finishing higher in this
blind voting thing that we did because they happen to
do that really well. And that's a thing that
people really considered when they voted on them. I haven't said this a lot, but I think this is one
of the earliest reasons that I actually really
liked RED cameras was, you know, obviously 8K is great, Color Science is great,
but the way it represents and renders my skin tone
accurately over a lot of, you know, the Sonys and the ARRIs and Canons that I've tried, that's actually one of the things that really drew me to these cameras. So all this software stuff
is why photo comparisons between modern smartphones is so hard. Like there are a lot of channels
that do a really good job with the side-by-side
photo test, you know, but even as you're trying to
like pick one over the other, you've probably noticed this, you might like the way one of them renders landscape photos over the other but the way a different one renders photos with your own skin tone and then the way a different one renders photos
of your pet, for example. So I'm sure Apple will defend
everything they're doing now with their current cameras
as they typically do. But I'm gonna keep an
eye on what I'm also sure which is they're for sure working on tuning these new
cameras, dialing it in, and eventually getting it better with the iPhone 15 and 15 Pro. So back to the original question from the beginning of the video, we can't leave that unanswered, which is, ""All right, the Pixel 6a, you like the Pixel photos, Marques, it won the blind scientific camera test but you still gave the trophy for best overall camera
system to the iPhone, the very 14 Pro that
we've been talking about this whole video, why?"" And if you listen carefully,
you already got it, which is that scientific test that we did tested one specific thing, it tested the the small
postage-stamp-sized, you know, exposure and
colors general thing with a bunch of different factors, but sharpness and detail with all the compression
that we did wasn't tested. Also, speed of autofocus, reliability of autofocus wasn't tested. The open-close time of the camera app, how fast and reliable you can
get a shot, wasn't tested. And also video wasn't tested. So the microphone quality, video quality, speed and reliability of autofocus there, file formats, sharpness, HDR,
all that stuff, wasn't tested. Maybe someday we will test
all that, but until then, the lesson learned is the pretty pictures that come from the Pixel or
whatever phone's in your pocket are partly photons, but
primarily processing. (relaxed music) Thanks for watching. Catch you guys the next one. Peace. (record crackling)","What’s the solution 😢 | I just bought iPhone 16 (from iPhone 11) and its absolutely terrible. | Deep fusion killed iphone camera | Cameras were never calibrated for lighter skin tones. Do have any idea how silly that sounds? They were calibrated to an agreed upon metering that adjusts full frequency light, white light, to 18% grey. So in a scene with high contrast, white on black, yes, the darks will be underexposed. Photographers who know their trade easily adjust for this using aperture, shutter or exposure controls settings. | The bottom line is that if you are serious about photography and getting good at the art.......don't begin your study of photography with ANY cell phone camera. They are junk compared to cameras with good lenses. Also, the software enhancements you talked about are called post-processing and cell phones try to do all that for you because, again, the engineers know that the users are less than serious photographers, generally, and will not know how to do it well using Adobe Lightroom, for example. The Sony Alpha you show does not do all that in-camera editing and captures the image in pure form, leaving the fiddling to be done by the photographer in post processing. Lastly, cell phones do not capture RAW files, as a matter of course. That alone tells you everything.

5NjFuS_24v8,Smartphone Awards 2022!,The Best Smartphones of 2022! MKBHD Merch: http://shop.MKBHD.com Affiliate Links: Samsung S22 Ultra at ...,2022-12-27T22:00:10Z,5441071,214725,10809,"(steady music) - All right. Welcome to the Smartphone Awards 2022. It's one of my favorite videos. Y'all knew it was coming. It's a bit of a tradition around here to revisit the smartphones that came out during
the calendar year 2022. And then I like to recognize
and reward some of the best and some of the worst that came out and some of the interesting
stuff that happened during this calendar year. There's a lot, usually we forget
about a lot of this stuff, but this is one of my
favorite videos to make. We even have, of course, no spoilers, but we've got some trophies
for the winners as well. They're super nice. So, from flagships to
midranges to budget phones to specialty phones to folding
phones, I got to use 'em all. I got, I have my own opinions
about them, and you know, some of you may agree
with some of these awards. Some of you may disagree, but one thing is for sure
is they're my awards. So without any further ado,
let's start giving 'em out. So, the first category is best big phone. Now, I mean, look at this table. Obviously, phones have gotten
bigger and bigger over time, to the point where pretty
much every phone is big. But I still like to reward a phone that had a great use of that space because you still want a big screen but also a big battery,
maybe big speakers, some nice cameras, and the whole thing, just being a good use
of all that extra space. And so, my winner for the best big phone of the year actually came out right near the beginning of it. And that is Samsung's Galaxy S22 Ultra. (gentle music)
So hardware-wise, I feel like this one just pretty
much did it all here. It's got the big 6.8 inch display, one of the absolute best in the business. It added a stylus but still included a 5,000
milliamp hour battery which is the same as the year before. Multiple great cameras on the back, a pair of great telephotos,
good speakers, good software, really no hardware flaws to speak of, to the point where maybe you'd
say it was kind of boring which I think is actually a good thing. If you're looking to spend
this much on a phone, you don't want anything
to be too weird about it. And so, yeah, this one's the category in a way that I think the
Notes usually did in the past. So, it's sort of a return of the Note. But I do also give some runner-ups and honorable mentions in
some of these categories too. And that's what I'm gonna
do in best big phone, which means the runner-up
is the ASUS ROG Phone 6. Really similar actually in a lot of ways to Samsung's flagships, just
missing a couple little things. It's a little more specialized,
no wireless charging, but it's got a screen on the back and it's much more gaming centric. But I got shout it out for the incredible, massive
stereo front facing speakers and also the headphone jack. Big phone, it should have
room for a headphones jack. And then also a little shout out, a little honorable mention
to the Xiaomi Mix Fold 2. This, it didn't have an IP
rating, it wasn't quite, you know, available
for everyone worldwide. But this is one of those folding phones where it folded just to
about the same thickness as a normal phone, which is sort of like one of
those breakthrough moments in folding phones, I think. And now we can start to feel like they're on their way towards being usable. Big phone, smaller package.
(phone clicking) All right, next category, best small phone. So now, we're on the other
end of the spectrum, right? There are not a lot of small phones and this is a rare category. And I'll be honest, this one wasn't close. So, last year's winner,
as you might recall, was the iPhone Mini. They killed that this year, so that wasn't even gonna qualify. So, what would be the best
small phone of the year? It's the best small phone I've ever seen. And that is ASUS Zenfone 9. This phone is so nice
(gentle music) and they made a lot of great decisions across the board here. So, small, it's relative,
but it's a 5.9 inch display, relatively compact, flagship specs, Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, a 1080p, higher refresh rate, OLED, great software, tons of ram, really fast, and
a surprisingly great camera. And if this phone this small
can have a headphone jack, then what's everybody else's excuse? Right? There are a lot of great
things I liked about it. It did have a couple weird flaws, like this weird soft touchback that ended up discoloring a lot. I talked about that in the main review. But like, man, I was very surprised by the battery life on this phone. There's not a lot of things
I get genuinely surprised about in the smartphone world now, but a phone in this small having
such a great battery life, this is easily, easy, best
smartphone in this size. But I will give a little
honorable mention, a little runner up though, because there was a certain phone that came out right at
the very end of the year. You guys might have wondered
why this video was so late. I'll give partial credit to this one. Oppo Find N2, this is that
little passport sized phone. It's got these flat edges and
it's still a folding phone which has got a pretty
solid display on the inside. I haven't done a full review about it yet but it feels like
(phone clicking) this is a bit of a preview to what a folding Pixel might look like which is really interesting. But all right, let's
get to the next category which is best camera, or should
I say, best camera system across the board? Because there is a lot to a good camera from photo quality to video quality but also speed of capture
and auto-focus reliability and ease of use and file formats
and all this other stuff. So, we did something really
interesting this year. We did a blind smartphone camera test in the form of a website that we built where we gave everyone the ability to vote on whatever photos they like
in three different categories. And we had 16 different phones from the year all competing
against each other. And the overall winner across all three categories
was the Pixel 6A, incredibly. And actually, runner up
to it was the Pixel 7. So, these are clearly some
really good photo quality phones but I'm not giving them the
trophy for best camera system. I'm also not giving it
to the vivo X80 Pro+ or X90 Pro+, which were low light kings. They had a really great combination of software and a really
impressive sensor. The hardware stack is great, but no, my winner for best overall camera system in 2022 is going to the iPhone 14 Pros. (gentle music) So, this has now become the
longest defending champion of a single category ever. This is the fourth year in a row the iPhone has taken
down the camera category, because again, it's
great across the board. So, image quality as we
know is solid, right? We knew that. But the time to open the camera to actually snap a photo
is extremely quick. The auto focus is fast. I'd say, you could fairly
give the Pro iPhones like an A minus to a B plus for photos. But then in the video department, it's a whole different dimension and it's not really even close. I've been running the
auto-focus YouTube channel now for a couple months, doing
a lot of videos on cars, shot entirely on smartphones. And you can tell the difference when I shot a video on the iPhone's camera versus the other smartphone cameras. It's how good it looks. It's the audio quality. It's the consistency of color. It's the pro res, the sharpness. I much prefer shooting videos on iPhones and I think I'm not alone there. And I'll say, it still takes a long time to get the files off of the iPhone and I hope they fix that. But it's the winner
for best camera system. Okay, so next up, let's do the battery. This is the best battery overall. I think this is one of the more objective categories probably, but it's including a
little more, obviously, than just the battery size. I wanna include just
the battery experience, how long it takes to charge,
how long it lasts on a charge, battery flexibility of
features and things like that, how long the battery health does. And so, my winner for best battery in a 2022
phone, it is a defending champ. It is the ASUS ROG Phone 6.
(gentle music) This one has not a 4,000, not a 5,000, but a 6,000 milliamp hour battery. It's got 65 watt fast charging, so you can go from zero
to full in under an hour. And on top of that, there is a bevy of battery
management features. So obviously, you can
turn the 165 hertz display down all the way to 60 hertz if you want to and get a ton of battery. But then there's also like
charge limit features, pass through charging, things like that. This phone is a king as far as battery life experience and it actually charges fast. Probably the only knock against it is that it doesn't have wireless charging, which most other phones in
its price range do have. But as far as just worry-free
battery, that's the winner. And I will give a runner up in this category to the iPhone 14 Plus. So, a lot of us kind of saw this coming when Apple killed the Mini iPhone in favor of a plus-sized iPhone that doesn't have the
promotion OLED display. So, this is a big, simple 60 hertz display that is just powered by a
massive battery in the iPhone, massive four in iPhone. And so, with wireless charging and with all the other
things that Apple does to prevent batteries from having problems, I'd say that's a pretty
great battery experience. And I'll also give a quick
shout out, an honorable mention, because the ASUS Zenfone 9, I gotta, I keep coming back to this, the way it surprised me with battery life. This is a 4,300 milliamp
battery in this phone. It also doesn't have wireless charging. The charging speed is decent, but I was genuinely shocked by how well this phone held up on battery. It's, who would've
thought that a phone small like this would've one
of the best batteries of any phone that came out
during the calendar year? But anyway, okay, next
up is the design award. I feel like this is the
hardest one every year to think of or to give out, just because it is the
most subjective now. This is, it's actually
changed over the years. It used to be, I think I
called it best build quality or just best overall build or materials or industrial design. But it's eventually
just evolved into like, who can step outside of the box and do things a little
different design-wise? 'Cause that honestly
does not happen very much in smartphones these days. And sometimes, it kind
of feels like a process of elimination, like, oh, I can't give this to a phone
that played it too safe, right? Lots of phones look basically
the same as last year. I definitely can't give it to a phone that made like an obvious regression from the year before or
has like a glaring issue with build or materials or failed, jerry rig,
everything's test or something. I can't give it to an
iPhone either, can I? I mean, they still have the biggest notch, but, oh there's the
Dynamic Island though too. Maybe, no. The design award for 2022 is gonna go to the Nothing phone. The Nothing Phone won. Get it?
(gentle music) The design I think is
literally the best thing about this phone, maybe second best. So, it's got this sort of transparent look which is definitely trying something new. And then the glyph interface
with these lights on the back, they light up for notifications. They can also light up as a fill flash for video if you want. It also has a wireless
charging indicator on the back. It definitely skirts the line right between gimmick and feature. Like, a lot of people will get this phone and have fun with it for a week
and then never use it again. But I find it really neat. I think it's cool that you can see how much
battery is as you're charging. I don't know, little things like that. You don't see a lot of
phones trying new stuff. The rest of the phone happens
to be pretty good too. So, I have no problem
giving the Nothing Phone the design award for 2022. And then I do also want to
give an honorable mention in design to that Xiaomi Mix Fold 2. There were a number of folding phones that came out during this year, but as I mentioned earlier, this is the first one that
sort of passed that barrier of actually being the same
thickness as a normal phone. I mean, look at, this is another phone that
came out during this year. It's very close in overall thickness. So, a lot of phones you pick up, like this is Samsung's folding, you, it just feel, it's thicker
than a normal phone. And you'd think about that all the time when you're using it. So, I wanted to reward this
one for actually getting to that point where now, there's other things to fix
still about folding phones, but this feels very usable and pocketable and gives you the benefits of unfolding to a huge screen. (phone clicking)
Shout out to Xiaomi. All right, let's give out a value award. I like this one. This is, this was actually pretty
close as well this year too. Notice it's one of the
more controversial awards. It used to be best budget phone but budget means something
different for everyone. So, I'm just calling this
like best bang for the buck. You can kind of picture
the pyramid of phones, and when you see a good one, you know what I'm talking about. When you see a phone
that has a great price, I'm going by launch price, MSRP. So, the winner, my, I'm giving
my winning by a little bit, best value award to the Pixel 7. This phone came out at 599
(gentle music) and it's one of the best
599 phones I have ever seen. I mean it's pretty clear. It's the whole Google flagship experience. It's also got the tensor chip flagship, same as the more expensive one. It's also got the same main sensor, the same flagship camera
as the more expensive one. It has a great 90 hertz OLED flat display. It's so good that it made
the 7 Pro kind of feel like not that good of a deal 'cause 599, there is not
a lot that you can get for this price that does this well. In fact, I'd argue nothing. So, this is one of my favorite phones that came out this year, but it just barely beats out another one of my favorite phones
that came out this year which is ASUS Zenfone
9, really unique combo for this one which launched at 699. It also now has the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1. It's got a ton of ram, 120 Hertz display, a flat OLED again, but also like the fingerprint
reader on the side, a headphone jack and
incredible battery life. I mean these two phones
could go back and forth head to head. I could easily be swayed here. But those two were awesome to see. That's probably the best
699 phone I've ever seen. And among the myriad of other
really good sub $400 phones that came out, I want to
give an honorable mention to the Realme 10 Pro+. This had a big 6.7 inch display. You can see the cameras on the back, 5,000 milliamp hour battery. But this camera performed
surprisingly well to a lot of people. It ended up beating thousand dollar phones and it was second place
in votes per dollar in our blind smartphone camera test. Really good overall package
for about 350 bucks. I like the way this launched and I think if you can get
over the way it shines, it's a really good one. All right, bust of the year. You know, we give it out every year. You don't like giving it out, but it's the one you hate to have to give. You know, there's a lot of phones that played it really
safe, which is interesting. And you could argue for
a lot of boring phones to just have been too
boring, bust of the year, I wish they did something
more exciting or interesting but I don't know. A lot of phones these
days are very similar to their previous years and
I won't penalize 'em for that if the previous phone is good. I really only had one
pick for bust of the year and that's the OnePlus 10T,
(gentle music) not a whole ton to say here. It wins this award for
having a pretty big delta between expectations and
possibilities versus actual result. Not all of that is OnePlus's fault, but I mean they've been on
this slight downward trend of value and reputation
and software experience and cameras and a whole bunch
of other things like that. There's just not a whole lot to like, and it also just feels
like the identity has sort of been eroded very quickly over time. We just had the Hasselblad thing added to the previous OnePlus flagship phone and then the 10T comes out and they don't even bother with it. I don't know if they're
saving it for the pro phones, but it's like, what do you, what is this? What do you even say about
OnePlus phones anymore? There's no, you can't even
describe a OnePlus phone without feeling really generic. So anyway, yeah, congrats on
your award, bust of the year. So that brings us to the MVP, the most valuable phone? Nah, it's not the value award, it's the, it's my favorites list. That's kind of what this has turned into. Like, the best overall phone combined with the best overall experience, the best impact on the industry. There's a bunch of different things that can float you to the
top of my favorites list from the smartphones
that came out this year. And there are a lot of really good ones. You've just heard about great cameras, great big phones, great battery lives, great value, some surprises. This was a really close
one for me, really tough. Again, I could be swayed. I don't even wanna say that about the MVP, but I really think it's that close. I have two MVPs, okay? But I'm giving my top dog,
my number one MVP award for 2022 to the Pixel 7. (gentle music)
This phone, it deserves it for sure. Like you heard about in its previous win, great value, okay? Incredible cameras, great display, flagship software experience,
really good battery life, not a whole lot missing. And that's kind of what you get with a phone like this,
which is like, all right, the 7 Pro came out for 300 more dollars. And that's actually a phone that I've used a lot to this day. But what do you really get more for that? The telephoto camera, the
extra 30 hertz on the display, like this phone is such a good deal that it's hard to recommend the 7 Pro. I love recommending the 7. It's just an overall excellent phone and I'm glad that Google
found their groove 'cause I actually just forgot, I haven't given out the most
improved award yet either. And that's also the Pixel 7. (gentle music)
Google really found their groove with this phone. And to be fair, there are a lot of people who might criticize the design. They don't like, you
know, the visor as much. I kind of like the glass visor of the 6 a little bit more
to be perfectly honest. But I actually like that it's unique. If you look at a phone from far away, you know exactly what a
Pixel phone looks like. From across the street, you know what a pixel looks like, right? They're doing this advertising thing. They're actually getting
into people's hands. I just did my assistant battle, and like, the assistant
that runs on this phone, especially on the Pixel, is excellent. The voice recorder app,
all the smart features, hold for me, the screen call feature. I just, I can't say enough good things. Pixel 7, great package,
overall, love this phone. So, why am I so torn? What is the other phone
that is such a good year that I have a hard time
only picking one MVP? Well, it's the Zenfone 9, baby. This phone, this had a lot
of good things going for it, and it was one of my favorite phones, one of my biggest surprises of the year. Where do I start? The design I really liked, despite not having the best
wear and tear experience. I'm not a big case person, so I gotta give it a knock for that. No wireless charging. But the Snapdragon 8+ Gen
1 had amazing performance. This phone's battery life was incredible. It didn't charge fast, but
like I was just amazed by that. It has a headphone jack. It has the fingerprint reader on the side which was very fast but also had gestures and
surprisingly good cameras. I mean, these things ended
up top five, top four, maybe top three in our blind
smartphone camera test, voted by the masses. So, ASUS has had great cameras for years. I just really liked this phone. It's more expensive. It was 699 on launch. I think they did this weird thing in the US where it launched for more. But like, if you can get
your hands on this phone and pop a sim card tray in it and it actually will work
well with your carrier, the Zenfone 9 was a very close
second for my MVP for 2022. But then one more, I want to give an honorable mention to the old boring Galaxy S22 Ultra. It's an expensive phone, it
has all the hardware features. It didn't really do anything wrong. It just happens to have one of the biggest batteries
and the best display in the business and one of the best camera
suites in the business and one of the best processors. I mean, it's a boring,
really solid overall phone and that's why it won best big phone. And so, I'll give it
that honorable mention because a lot of us wanna see the, just the best overall phone
of the year highlighted and specs-wise and what
it does for people, I think that's a really
good phone to pick, of course, right alongside
the ROG phone, I could go on. Lots of great phones came out this year, but that's been it for the
Smartphone Awards of 2022. Feel free to leave all the notes in the comment sections below. I know all of you guys
will have thoughts on this, as we do every year. We'll talk about it. But of course, if you're
a company seeing this and you want your trophy, let me know. Hit me up on Twitter or something. I'll literally ship it out to you. I've done that before. Okay, that's been it. Thanks for watching. ♪ Talk to me ♪ - Alicia Keys said she

Q2MGqmuEdtU,The Voice Assistant Battle! (2023),Google Assistant vs Apple's Siri vs Amazon Alexa vs Samsung's Bixby. May the best voice assistant win! The Damascus skin is ...,2022-12-24T21:50:39Z,4621417,273024,6130,"- [Marques] What's your name? - [Siri] I'm Siri, pleased to meet you. - [Google] My nickname
is the Google Assistant. - [Bixby] The name is Bixby. - [Alexa] I'm Alexa. (bright upbeat music) - I've talked and made jokes in the past mostly along the lines of
Google Assistant is clearly the best virtual assistant
and then Bixby, Siri and Alexa are various
levels of far behind. But last time I did this
type of test was 2017 so I figured we should
revisit this a little bit, retest things and figure out if Google Assistant still actually is the best virtual assistant
on a smartphone right now. Also shout out to Clippy, the
original virtual assistant whose ugly Christmas sweater for Microsoft is actually what inspired
this one, the MKBHD 8-bit Drip which you can get wall supplies last. They're very limited but they're at shop.mkbd.com, link below. But I decided to start
with the simple questions. You know The three things
that you ask from an assistant the most often I think are
the weather, timers and facts. So they all do fine with
the weather question, probably the number one
query for me anyway. And then for the most part, they were also the same pretty quick with just asking standard facts, although for some reason they did disagree on the height of one person. But then for timers, for
timers, for one weird reason Siri cannot do multiple
timers at the same time on the iPhone. If you have a timer running
and ask for a second timer, it asks you every time
if you want to replace the first timer. Pretty basic stuff that I'm not sure why
Apple hasn't fixed yet. Especially because you
can set multiple timers at the same time with
Siri on a HomePod mini. But anyway, I don't wanna make you watch a whole bunch of back to back
to back questions and answers because I admit it was kinda
boring when I was doing all of that testing but I'm
going to share some examples of what I found with you and
then some of the highlights of the testing and the way
it answers these questions when you interact with them. So here we go. So with all the latest software
updates on every assistant, all being asked the exact same questions, asked to do the exact same
tasks with the same phrasing and on the same WiFi connections, most often the fastest one to answer was Google Assistant or Siri. But, but Siri and Bixby, in my experience, did have the most
instances of like hanging and pausing and not really
answering a question. Kinda like acting like they
had a poor internet connection even though they didn't. Not sure why they did that. A restart of the phone
helped with the Bixby one. Siri just kinda does it randomly, not sure why but that's a real fact. But then with straight up fact questions, there is no runaway winner which I think is a good thing actually. So if you ask something
that's easily Googleable or on Wikipedia, something
like how tall is the Taj Mahal? They can all get it. Or if you ask, what do whales eat? They all had some type of answer for me that was basically the same. Siri I found relies the
most heavily on Wikipedia as a source for almost all of its answers. And then when it does have
to go outside of that, it just kinda throws up a web search link often with Wikipedia at the top, says, ""Look what I Googled for you."" Now Google Assistant is
the most likely to give you a nice visual and
slightly more information than you asked for. Bixby is powered by Google so I would say it's
the most likely to read what Google assistant reads word for word. And then Alexa is the
most likely to throw in some extra information about
your latest Amazon order or something random. So facts, they can all do, great. Then there is what I'd call
the device control category because these are assistants
that are on your smartphones, they're smart speakers as
well but on your phone, you'd like to be able to
help you out with things while you can't use your hands. And for this, there was a
runaway winner, actually two and that would be Google
Assistant and Bixby. So with the most basic, basic stuff, they're pretty much all fine. They can all change their
screen brightness, for example, except Alexa. But they can also all open the camera or pretty much any app on your
phone with a voice command. That's easy. Setting an alarm is light work. If you ask it actually
to open the app store, they all open their respective app stores and actually Bixby opens
the Samsung Galaxy Store which is kinda cheeky. But when it starts to get more complex, Google and Bixby start to
walk away from the others. So if I ask it to take a selfie, Siri and Alexa will just open the camera but Bixby and Google
actually open the camera, switch to the selfie camera and start a self-timer and
actually take a selfie. If I wanna say play
""Squid game"" on Netflix, both Google and Bixby will
actually open the Netflix app, find the first episode of
""Squid Game"" I haven't seen yet or wherever I left off
and start playing it. Siri just opens the app and Alexa is lost. If I say start a voice recording
or a voice memo for Siri, again, Google and Bixby
open the voice recording app and actually start that recording. Siri again just opens the app. And again, Alexa is lost. These voice commands when they
work are legitimately faster than I would've been able to do it by hand for the most part. And there's a bunch of
other device specific stuff that Samsung has programmed
into Bixby where it can reach into apps and perform
specific commands within them. So if there are apps who use a lot, this can potentially
save you a lot of time. Bixby was also great at
this last time I did it and also Alexa is unsurprisingly
the worst at device control because they aren't
making their own phone. These aren't Amazon phones. So the vertical
integration's great with Siri and Google Assistant and
Bixby, not with Alexa, not a shocker there. What might be a little
bit of a surprise though is conversationalism. Who is the coach of the Phoenix Sons? Huh, how tall is he? (soft upbeat music) Did he play in the NBA? (soft upbeat music) What team did he play for? (soft upbeat music) So you can see, Siri tapped out after about four questions
in a row about the same thing but Google Assistant
is incredible at this. It's really, really good
at remembering the context and the subject of a natural conversation and carrying that on through
a bunch of questions in a row. Where is the Taj Mahal? (soft upbeat music) Okay, how tall is it? (soft upbeat music) How many meters is that? (soft upbeat music) What is it made of? (soft upbeat music) See, again, Google remembers
what we're talking about. When is the Weeknd's birthday? (soft upbeat music) What's their latest album? (soft upbeat music) What's his real name? (soft upbeat music) So basically, if you're asking
a bunch of questions in a row or if you have one subject that you want to basically research
through the voice assistant or get a bunch of answers on, your best bet is definitely
Google Assistant. And then one more interesting
thing from the crew is that I ask just as
far as getting pictures. When you ask for pictures of something like dogs for example,
they can all search the web except Bixby didn't. And Alexa, which is looking
for an Amazon Photos app for some reason. But when you say, show
me my pictures of dogs, Google actually opens and
searches in my own Photos album for my own pictures of dogs. So I did a bunch of
other testing like this with a bunch of other different questions, different styles of questions, follow up questions and things like that and I've come to a
pretty solid conclusion. So if you're wondering
which one is the best; ""Marques, you did all these tests, ""which one came out as number one?"" Only one thing became exceptionally clear through all this testing
which is that Alexa is clearly the worst, is
clearly far behind the others as a smart assistant on a phone. I mean, unless maybe you're already deep in the Amazon Alexa ecosystem with everything working
perfectly in your smart home. Matter of fact, this really
is an ecosystem question almost as much as it is a skills question for the assistants. Because if you are super all in on one of these smart home ecosystems, that actually could answer
the question for you. Of course, if you're all in with HomeKit, then Siri and then iPhone
is your only option to view your cameras and
see your doorbell ringing and turn on your lights
and all that stuff. But if you are doing the
same with Google Home and Google Assistant, then you're there. Now the next Gen Matter
standard may change all of this. It may actually make
this section irrelevant, maybe leave the thumbs up
on this video or comment if you're interested in a
video about that specifically. But for now, with these different
silos of home ecosystems, that's pretty important. But I'll still say from
my most common experiences and queries and the things
that are most useful; across every single phone,
iPhones or Android phones, the most useful assistant
is still Google Assistant. And that's multiplied if
you also happen to have a pixel phone because then
you also get call screening and Hold for Me and all
those extra pixel features. But in general, Google Assistant
is most likely to be fast. It's most likely to give a
good well sourced answer. It's most likely to be conversational and remember context longer. And it has a bunch of third party plugs, tons of app support. And I also happen to
have built my smart home in the Google Home world so it's great. Now for the second best, I'm
very tempted to say Bixby. Of course though, this is only relevant if you have a Samsung phone. And also, it is basically
saying all the same first query responses
that Google assistant was minus the ability to
talk to a smart speaker since Samsung would probably
like us to forget about that. But I am gonna have to put
Siri in second place here. It's fine, it's okay it's all right, it's fine, it's not great but it is the most well
plugged into Apple's ecosystem. So of course, if you're
doing HomeKit stuff, it's gonna work well there. It does support a smart speaker
which can do multiple timers if you're not doing stuff
all the time on your phone. And it does support routines which is like stacking a
bunch of different commands into one action if you're
willing to dig through the very convoluted Siri
shortcuts interface. So that puts Bixby in third
place and Alexa is just bad, it's just bad on a phone. Like there was a phone a couple years ago, an HTC phone where it was built in so there was Google Assistant
and Alexa side by side on the same phone and it
worked kinda well back then but that was years ago and
Alexa is just dead last on a phone right now and Amazon knows it. Amazon is falling behind with Alexa and if you're just
starting to use assistants or put together a smart
home or this type of stuff, I would say avoid things that
are Alexa exclusive right now. But until then, let me know if you agree that Google Assistant still
seems pretty far out in front or maybe there are some
specific features that you find the most useful in a virtual assistant. Let me know in the comments. Either way, channel sponsor Dbrand, also would like you to know
that they are relaunching the Damascus skin. They're bringing it back
due to popular demand. It's got all this like crazy
reflective holographic chaos. You can kinda skin whatever
device you want too so you can make it work and you
get a free Triple Black skin with your order, which is
sick, I'll link it below. Thanks for watching and I'll
catch you guys in the next one. Peace.

9nF0K2nJ7N8,Tesla Self Driving vs Everyday Roads!,An uninterrupted drive with Tesla Full Self Driving (beta) Version #: 10.69.3.1 (2022.36.20) Full PLAID review coming soon to ...,2022-12-14T23:08:36Z,6580051,168415,12237,all right so do you remember when Elon Musk said that Teslas would soon be able to just drive themselves across the entire country with no one in the driver's seat thanks to full self-driving I remember that too but that's not real yet but this demo that I'm going to start right now is as close to that as I can possibly get I'm gonna hit this button on the steering wheel and I have the navigation set and this car will now drive me to the studio I will attempt to interrupt this as few times as possible but as you'll see it has its strengths and weaknesses and there are probably going to be times where I do have to either put my foot on the brake or take over steering or do something for the car the number one reason I've had to do that so far is not safety but actually just embarrassment like it just slammed on the brakes seeing that car backing up and now it has the blinker on for some reason but it's way too early it needs to go all the way to the stop sign now it's going and then it used to handle a roundabout so pedestrians oncoming cars there's a lot going on I have a feeling I'm gonna have to interrupt on this roundabout we'll see there's a lot happening but the bread and butter is definitely highway driving so we'll see you get to that point and we'll see what it does so now it's creeping forward and it has to deal with New Jersey drivers which is kind of a lot visibility cars moving in and out I am a little bit nervous it's she's waving me on thanks but it's also looking at that car so it might hit the brakes but it doesn't Okay heads to the roundabout Dives right in hits the brakes for some reason makes it through okay hits hits this turn for some reason oh that's the okay that's the navigation and we're off this is like there's a lot going on here and I'll talk you through it through this whole uncut video we have the camera facing me we have the camera facing forward but I'm gonna try not to cut through them too much and I will not cut anything out of this drive so right now the speed limit according to the signs that it's red is 35 miles an hour and it can default to up to 10 miles an hour over the speed limit so now it's comfortably going 45 totally fine there's lots of cops like this one that don't seem to mind so that's cool uh but it's also coming up to a turn here so it's gonna have to slow down put the blinker on and hit that left turn so it slows down puts the blinker on it's got some oncoming traffic and it also has this car here over the line but we'll see what happens New Jersey drivers tend to not let you in but they're letting me in so it makes the turn don't hit anything okay oh man apply a light Force so every once in a while you're gonna see it light up the screen in front of me and it says to apply a light Force to the steering wheel because the idea is this is just a little bit more than regular traffic aware cruise control so it wants to make sure my hand is still on the wheel so it wants a little bit of firm pressure on the wheel every once in a while this is a hard merge this is a highway speed Route 17 entrance ramp and I'm not so sure how it's going to handle this one let's let's give it a chance here there's also a car really close to the edge so autopilot's creeping forward and checking for visibility and I have a feeling it's just going to wait until they get a red light over there because it says on this screen it's going to try to get into the second lane and that's just not happening at the speeds I've seen this go so I'll just say that the most common interference that I've had to do like I said was by embarrassment there we go it's because it tries to be very cautious so it just went out into the third lane there which is fine because there was no one behind me but now it's speeding up and it says upcoming Lane change to get into the left lane because we'll need to make a left-hand exit off of 17. tap to cancel if you want but I'm totally cool with that it slowly speeds up 60 miles an hour max and it's comfortable there's the blinker it checked my shoulder it changed lanes I I definitely feel more comfortable with it on a highway than anything um but also if I just open up my camera here and point it at this Dash this is one of the reasons why they said there is a yoke in these cars is because the top half of the steering wheel would have blocked this otherwise really impressive view of all of the things that the car sees and displays so it displays the road the signs the other vehicles around you pedestrians I'll fire the camera up again when there's a lot more impressive stuff to show but as of right now we're taking an entrance ramp to a new highway and then we'll have to do an exit and another entrance which is interesting light forces steering wheel uh what else oh there's a camera up here in the middle of the car and what I've noticed because I've had this beta for maybe two weeks now is if you look away from the road for too long that camera will notice and it'll start beeping at you and tell you hey look at the road or I'm going to pull over and stop doing the self-driving so that's good to know there's some construction signs up here I think it sees them let's see it let's see it merge there's a truck behind me I might have to take over it I'm gonna take over so that's a pretty good instance of an unusual set of things on the road I'll re-engage here uh that it just didn't seem to pick up where if you were driving it would arrive at those unusual things and I'm sure if I wasn't as embarrassed I could have just let it figure that out for a few more seconds but I'd rather not do that I'd rather just let it do its thing on roads it's comfortable with but as you can see it sees those cones over there and it is going to try to take this exit and I don't think it's going to get this okay let's let's see what happens it says upcoming land change with some cones I would be really impressed and that construction detected navigation on autopilot limited says that on the screen and yeah I'm gonna have to take over it did not know that it had to take that exit there uh that's fine but what I do know is the actual highway driving part is typically it's Forte so this is what I'm calling the full self-driving beta but what I've used in the past is just a much more limited version of what Tesla calls autopilot most people don't understand that that's literally just basically traffic where cruise control um and I mostly only use that on highways when it's like stop and go traffic and it's annoying to drive so let me turn it back on Auto steer temporarily unavailable interesting how about trying it again okay that time it did get mad at me weird so here comes the merge there's a car behind me he let me in cool and now there's a toll booth coming up which I think it can also handle because it's basically just staying in its Lane but we'll see about that I mean I have Easy Pass so it should follow the car in front of me cool apply light Force got it I'm sorry I'm sorry toll booth detected so it knew it was a toll booth but it did that right and here's another look at all the things it sees in front of me lots of cones the stripes on the other side of the road New Jersey drivers just doing insane things that's fine and now it sees that the speed limit is 35 miles an hour but I think when it gets on this highway it's going to know to bump up to highway speed so it takes this turn kind of slows down a little bit but now we're on the highway and it's bumped up to 65 miles an hour and it ramps up to the appropriate speed this is stressful this is not uh what you would hope which is like taking the stress out of driving and just being a passenger and looking around and having a good time this is a lot more making sure the car doesn't do weird things um okay there are three settings here if I go into this uh settings for autopilot on the car you scroll down full self-driving beta has either average chill or assertive for the driving profile now it's sitting here in the right lane behind the CRV I'm going 58 into 65. it's pretty chill but I do have it in assertive mode and it says that changes your follow distance and more frequent speed lane changes and will not exit passing Lanes so theoretically on the next four and a half miles of Highway if it sees a gap it will move over into a faster passing Lane to pass this CRV I also still have a little bit of control here because right now it sees 65 mile an hour as its Max and that's actually totally in the flow of traffic right now but I'm going to bump that up to the 10 over that it's comfortable with to 75. so if it finds the gap as I sit behind this truck here in a not great spot if it finds the Gap it will overtake it'll change lanes and it will stand a passing Lane because it's in assertive mode Maybe I've been like hovering over the brake pedal this entire time okay this is much more reasonable uh parts of the drive what I also noticed is you know you're putting your destination to enable this full self-driving thing uh but it often doesn't know exactly when to end the navigation it might arrive at like a parking lot or a pullover on the side of the road where it thinks the GPS location is where your drive is supposed to end but it doesn't know to get into a parking space I mean we'll get to the studio and we'll just see what it does um but I have a feeling we're not going to end up in the parking spot I usually park in we'll find out when we get there though see a little bit traffic up ahead another Tesla I wonder if they're self-driving probably not uh but so far it has not found any reason to change lanes yet or pass this CRV even though it's set to 75. it's been comfortable sitting at 65 totally reasonable so yeah this is this is what it's like getting driven around by the car I mentioned elon's promise at the beginning elon's promise was kind of along the lines of uh these cars eventually becoming Robo taxis which is obviously a very far out promise and a a very optimistic looking future but theoretically you spend most of the time not in your car you'd commute in the morning you drive home in the afternoon and the rest of the time the car just sits around and does nothing for you so what if your car would drive like a lift for you or drive like an Uber for you while you're not using it if self-driving was good enough that could actually work uh yeah I don't think it's that good yet I would not feel comfortable sitting in the back seat of this car without the ability to intervene as this very moment uh there are some cars passing me a little bit weird in the lane here kind of ping-ponging back and forth between the lane changes and now it's finally deciding to Lane change confirm Lane change into faster so use the signal to do that so I hit the signal to confirm that I wanted to move into the faster Lane now I'm in the faster Lane and it's going to finally pass that CRV in the middle cool honestly I'm totally fine with it on a highway I feel much more comfortable with what it does in these very obvious roads that don't have construction that are well lined I will also note though that Tesla has moved their systems entirely to Vision based meaning they just use the cameras no radar no lidar and we're doing this in a pretty comfortable set of driving conditions visually the sun might be in my eyes or whatever but like this is well lit there's not a whole lot of crazy things going on but what if it was snowing or what if it was just white out fog or there was a lot of rain and it was hard to see the lines on the road I kind of wonder if full self-driving takes a meaningful hit in functionality if it just works worse there uh either way it's signaling an upcoming Lane change now to go back to the right lane because my exit is in one mile now a human driver would confidently just slow down and pop in there right there it's deciding not to do that it's going to keep following this truck and it has 0.9 miles to get over it to the right lane so it's passing this truck and this is one of those things where like the advantage of an electric car is the instant torque and the ability to just position yourself on the road anytime you want I would have made this Lane change a long time ago but it's saying now confirm Lane change to follow root and use the turn signal to confirm so I'll hit the signal but now it's got to really figure out when to get over I'm going to show you actually what it's showing me on the screen which is it's kind of picking a spot right now wow that is assertive that was an assertive move right there okay that qualifies as assertive it picked a spot on the road it put the blinker on and it did a little Jersey slide that was the best thing I've done so far all right one last highway exit and a toll here now I think the speed limit is about to change but we'll see it's got to put the blinker on here there you go exit stay on the lane thank you and we're about to hit some heavy braking I'm not going to interrupt okay good very nice the car sees a lot like it's very clear it can see three four five cars ahead of me and it can see the brake lights on all of the cars around me so it knows when cars are breaking before a human would even recognize it it instantaneously instantaneously sees that which is super cool uh so it can theoretically respond to things faster than I could but here comes the exit ramp nothing too insane here apply a light Force to the steering wheel yeah I'm still here I'm paying attention don't worry it's a big wide Lane this is a little sloppy but it works it works and I think that's kind of the motto of full self-driving beta right now it's kind of sloppy but it works dot dot okay coming around this last turn we've got a little over a mile to go to the studio it's behind this van it sees the van and it's about to hit one of the hardest merges in uh in the entire state of New Jersey which is like two to five and then five to two now it's gone this is not going to work if it doesn't see that it's yet there's a cone here it's not con yeah I'm taking over so that was bad there's a cone over there I took over and I also need to be back over to the right which this car did not position itself well for so I'm going to go back into the correct Lane here and get around these potholes and re-engage so two disengagements so far one for traffic cones on a highway that it had a really hard time recognizing to the point where the trucks behind me were slamming on their brakes and beeping at me and two was for a cone a single cone blocking one lane of a multi-lane merge with a toll booth admittedly not typical driving but as I hopefully merge here I'm gonna again hit the gas pedal I didn't disengage I just hit the gas pedal the accelerator pedal to give it a little oomph uh to make sure it got into that merge because it was about to hit the brakes and I was about to get beeped at by another truck this is the home stretch here and I don't think there's any more crate actually there are a little more interesting pieces of the drive left to go and then we'll see how it decides to park but yeah so far I feel like I'm kind of in the same place as where I started before I got the beta which is I'd watch some YouTube videos and it looked like it would be comfortable on a highway and not much else it looked like it kind of just wanted to Swerve to avoid that trash bag which is interesting and I've even noticed it do some kind of human things which will be like if you're on a road with a shoulder you need to get over you need to get over oh you're going to the next one cool I'll I'll be driving on a road with a shoulder and a biker on the shoulder and it'll move over a little bit in the lane to give the biker more room I think that's cool do not hit the brakes here there's a truck behind me thank you cool uh so it does some interesting human things and I believe that those are programmed in and I'm glad that they work but it does some also like embarrassing old lady things it maybe it's just embarrassing because it happens to be a car that's capable of like great driving um okay one last turn here blinker thank you I was just dealing with these trucks now this actually could get dicey yep truck is right on my bumper it can go around here but it's waiting that's fine I'll see what it does at the stop sign but I'm gonna guess one more disengagement that's my prediction man my heart rate is definitely higher during this drive than the average normal drive to the studio it's a lot it's a lot breathing I don't know let me know what you guys think in the comments about whether or not you trust a system like this I mean I think it's pretty clear you wouldn't want to be in the back seat but even if you have a car with this full self-driving beta which I will say it is a beta and it is not widely available and it's here we go here's the last bit why are you so far behind the truck human driver would have moved up by now truck has to do weird things so let's let the truck do weird things yep truck has to go now you go now you go now you go truck is still being slow so I am still being cautious yep go ahead autopilot's creeping forward checking visibility go ahead I won't disengage I'm not embarrassed I'm just driving like an old lady it's fine I think I just see the the grill of the truck like four inches from my back bumper like are you gonna go or not that's that's the experience the autopilot beta experience but yeah it's beta so you know would you trust this type of thing if you have the ability to take over or would you just drive like a normal driver I mean I live in this is New Jersey people don't have that type of patience uh this truck's going kind of slow because I think it's about to turn and so I almost guarantee someone's going to beep because the truck is just stopping in the middle of the road but I guess everyone can see that it's a truck and we're just kind of okay with that what is the truck doing if this truck backs up I am absolutely screwed please don't back up please don't back up please don't back up there's the beep I promised and he's stopped in the middle of the road he's got his hazards on and I don't think that this car knows what to do I believe I will have to do my predicted third disengage after this truck flies by me yeah he's just got his hazards on all right I'll just go around him not sure what happened there good luck to you with whatever you're doing all right let's see how it decides to end the drive so I'll re-engage and we can see we can see that there's one more stop sign and then it sort of turns into a parking lot and then it dropped a pin at the GPS coordinates of the end of the drive um so maybe it does decide to pull into the parking lot and then I can handle parking myself but I'm just kind of curious what it's going to end up doing anyway creeping forward driving forward I've been shadowing the pedals this entire time and now what I was going to pull into this parking lot well this is good oh chill chill okay I think it's decided that it's arrived I'll give a credit this is the front door that's that's enough autopilot for one day for me I'm just gonna pull over and take in look at I just want to open the camera one more time just to show you guys look at how much this car can see I'm in a parking lot right now with a pedestrian with dozens of other cars and it sees every single one of them it sees that stop sign right there it sees everything there's a lot going on with these cameras and with the the AI processing all the data very quickly on the computers inside the car but I'm going to end it there let me know in the comments what you think self-driving or not you trust this thing catch you guys later peace [Music],"Some

0gNauGdOkro,The Truth About AI Getting &quot;Creative&quot;,"Let's talk about AI Art, Lensa, ChatGPT, and why it's all deeper than you think. Save money with Karma at ...",2022-12-09T21:17:58Z,3012109,126039,8297,[Music] man where do I even start with this so you might have seen AI in a bunch of forms all over social media lately like I have whether it's making AI art or doing AI portraits or AI chat Bots having conversations and writing poems and all kinds of crazy stuff like that so I have a lot of questions about it but naturally I immediately went to the top of the most existential pyramid of questions which is just can this AI eventually replace me now before we get started I just want to make it clear that I am not saying AI can't do amazing things in fact AI algorithms and machine learning models are capable of some truly impressive Feats but when it comes to creating content online there are some fundamental reasons why AI can't replace human creators first let's define what we mean by online Creator at its core being an online Creator is a creative process right so it involves coming up with ideas developing content publishing it online engaging with an audience and this process requires imagination and creativity and a human perspective on the other hand AI is a machine learning technology it's not capable of imagination or creativity it doesn't have a human perspective instead it's a tool designed to process data and perform specific tasks in conclusion AI might be be able to perform some impressive tasks but it can't replace online creators because it's not capable of imagination creativity and a human perspective it's a tool not a Creator you wouldn't want to listen to an entire video created by an AI would you except you just did because every word that I just read to you came directly from asking open ai's AI chat bot called chat GPT to write a script for an MKBHD video on why AI can't replace online creators and I simply just recited it it's fascinating though isn't it I just did a video earlier this year on Dolly another project also by open aai where you input a text prompt and it spits out a realistic highresolution new unique art piece in whatever style you want and the art pieces are surprisingly detailed and realistic and it's accurate to the words you gave it it's such a powerful tool and so now this other tool by opening is also going viral and it's more along the lines of a a robot you can talk to a chat bot so it's called chat GPT and it's capable of holding a conversation back and forth about almost anything and so you can kind of have a normal conversation with it right now but the types of things people are asking of it are getting increasingly more and more complex you can ask it for some facts or you can ask it for the summary of a book or you can have it write a poem for you or ask it to find an error in some code or clearly just ask it to write a whole script for a YouTube video it is incredibly impressive what it's been able to do just kind of drawing from the database of all of human knowledge and then having intricate detailed nuanced conversations with people on a variety of topics so here's my actual real human take on the emergence of these new AI tools two things one is that really it's just kind of amazing that we're living through this time right now where we're able to see these tools evolve in front of our very eyes and get better and better but two is just that that's all it is is a tool in 2022 that's how I see it it's just a really impressive tool so I think the ideal use of this stuff especially as like a Creator like me is not to take my job but to use it as a creative tool to sort of brainstorm earlier in the process and then let me put my human touch on top of it later that's literally how I plan to use it so you can ask chat GPT to help brainstorm video ideas or even titles for these videos and that's what it'll do but then at the end of the day it'll be my human judgment that decides what I actually decide to publish so kind of like how you might already use the AI subject selection tool in Photoshop but then refine the edges and the selection yourself or you might use the AI sharpening tool the AI enhanced tool in pixel Mater but then go in and and do the rest of the edits to to Really match your style so it's the beginning of the process this new stuff we're seeing is just the next level of that the only difference here is this stuff is a much more General Ai and it is what we call a generative AI meaning it creates things seemingly from scratch so I think there will be people who ask chat GPT for the summary of a book and it can spit out an answer super fast and you can use that as inspiration for your own writeup I think there will be college students that use it to brainstorm an essay it won't be able to actually spit out a finished essay for you at this point but it is a pretty damn good start like clearly this is an amazing never-before-seen tool and it's the start of something huge I'll even continue to ask it for video script ideas why not but just keep in mind when I did it did say at the bottom that this should be a starting point for a video it didn't do any alliterations at the end like I usually do and it did get some facts wrong in the longer full version as you can see and that actually brings me to the dangers of something like this of course with any massively impactful new technology you have to at least consider this type of stuff and really two of them have come to my mind at the very top which are one the error rate and two the complexity of credit so I asked chat GPT to write a script for an MKBHD review of the iPhone 14 pro and it made one and it's actually pretty positive it goes over the specs it calls the display bright and vibrant and sharp perfect for watching movies and playing games or browsing the web and it calls it incredibly fast and responsive I think that's that's true and it says the standout new feature of this year is the camera system I would agree but then it says it has a 12 megapix ultrawide a 12 megapixel wide and a 12 megapix telephoto but as we know here on the MKBHD channel the iPhone 14 pro was the first one to actually have that 48 megapixel main camera chat GPT was just wrong here and it also shouted out the four colors silver gold graphite and Pacific Blue except those were the iPhone 12 Pros colors this year there's a space black and a new purple so chat GPT has a habit of getting at least one thing wrong every time you ask it something or at least every time I asked it something now on the you know the whole six paragraph video script thing like that's actually pretty impressive the fact that I got 90% of that pretty pretty well but I also asked the chat about something much more simple what's the fastest sea mammal on earth just curious and chat GPT said the fastest sea mammal on earth is the paragr falcon although it is not a sea mammal it is capable of reaching speeds of over 240 M hour while diving making it the fastest animal in the world other fast sea mammals include the sailfish which can swim at speeds of up to 68 mph and the Orca which can reach speeds of up to 34 mph now it's been a while since I've been in school but I'm pretty sure only one of those was a cammal and to be fair was the correct answer it did include the fact that an orca goes 34 mph that is the right thing to say but clearly you can't rely on this thing to be 100% factually accurate it's kind of the same way there's also like a 90% accuracy rate with Dolly but it feels more and more impressive the more complex your prompts are like if you ask dolly for a picture of a cat okay that's pretty easy so it is kind of jarring when it messes up some parts of something that seems so easy and obvious but when you ask for a cat wearing a rocket booster jumping over a man watering his garden in space it's like okay it's kind of amazing what it's able to generate from scratch to match the description and then it's also not shocking when maybe it gets one or two of those things wrong kind of just like that longer Essay with a few incorrect facts I expect these error rates to go down over time like that's kind of the whole point of these AI models advancing but you know that's something I'll keep an eye on the other thing though is credit and this is something you may have seen pop up a little bit on social media lately which is that AI Ste art without consent which here's what they mean by that so the number one app in the entire app store right now is something called lenza AI by Prisma Labs you might have seen some post on your timeline it's kind of blown up and the basic premise is you pay a few bucks and you upload a bunch of real photos of your face give it a few minutes and the black box of AI inside will spit out a bunch of cool avatar characters that look like you in a bunch of different situations and as a bunch of different characters some of them them much better than others I feel like it's kind of caught fire lately cuz most people don't typically have a bunch of cool art made about them so like it's kind of neat that you get to see that type of thing but there's some other companies jumping on this too uh Avatar AI is another one so now you are technically consenting to your uploading your own face for it to be used to train the models to put in these images but do you know who's not consenting to have their art used for this type of stuff a lot of the artists who are also making the art that's being fed in to inspire these AI images the backgrounds the materials the line work The Styling the framing Etc here here's something to keep an eye on you you know how most artists A lot of them will sign like the bottom right hand corner of their drawing or their painting when they're done well one of the telltale signs of potentially copyrighted art being used by these AI models without permission is a lot of people are getting back from this app with the mangled Recreations of a bunch of different signatures because clearly many of the source images that went into it had signatures at the bottom like that is wild so the unanswered question right now is how do you give credit to the artists whose work is being fed into the machine that is creating AI art like if I were to just ask dolly for a picture of a cat it could easily just spit out a brand new generic image of a photorealistic cat and it's learned through its models how to reproduce with stable diffusion what an image of a cat might look like inspired by theoretically any image of a cat on the internet that open AI has pulled in actually technically it's learned from the entire data set not just the images of cats but basically I don't think any artists would get too mad at that but you can also ask dolly for a picture of a cat in the style of Claude Monae and it becomes much more clear what source material is making it through to the final input and if I was Monae and I was still alive I'd probably wouldn't be too happy with this now I'm not a copyright lawyer so I'm not even going to try to get into what counts as transformative work or you know what's copyright infringement what's not but the bottom line is we don't actually really know the exact totality of exactly where these AI models are scraping from like there is some general description sometimes if you dig into it about publicly available images and licensed content but there are also some huge databases like there's something called common crawl that scrapes huge amounts of the internet and creates a publicly available free data set that anyone can use it's called lion 5B and again not a copyright lawyer but to me this kind of feels like a bit of the loophole doesn't it where technically common crawl they're not profiting from anything they're doing all the scraping of billions and billions of things and then putting it all in one place and then it's available for free and then others can decide what to do about that legal stuff so open AI you know they were using this data set and they were initially doing all this stuff for free but I think now it's like 15 bucks for for a set of 115 images something like that but especially like the ones you fed your face into the lenza one the Avatar AI one they're just straight up charging people they are making money from the data sets that they just crawled for free like think about it this way here's a here's a simple analogy if I were to make a YouTube video and I want to use Taylor Swift music in my YouTube video that's actually fine as long as I don't monetize my video so it's available for free that's cool if someone else wants to use a part of my video and they use the part with the Taylor Swift music in it can they make money off of that and on YouTube there's already an answer to this question which is no absolutely not you cannot make money off that umg is going to be coming after you in two seconds flat but in this world of AI art which is so new we kind of don't have an answer to that yet like there is no precedent set legally or culturally so at the beginning it felt like the biggest question was how do we Define art this is crazy question but now it feels like the more interesting question actually is what is inspiration exactly how do how do we Define inspiration like when a human draws something new of course it's a unique expression entirely of their own but of course they were also inspired by previous drawings that they might have seen in their life matter of fact they are technically inspired by every moment of their life leading up to the point where the pen touches is the paper and so now ai art is basically just speedrunning inspiration it's just like dumping all of recorded human history into a black box and then making something from it or maybe maybe just everything that's in data set lion 5B which includes a ton of my own work and thumbnails and images by the way but at the end of the day if I'm being an optimist which I try to be I hope this makes us appreciate human created art more for sure but we got to keep an eye on all these unanswered questions because there's a lot of them and uh until then let the robots rehearse the revolution you know it's not an unanswered question though the sponsor of this video karma karma is an online shopping tool designed to help you save money at your favorite stores but how do they help you save money so first it's not a crowdsourced coupon depository it scans the entire internet to find the best valid coupons for your purchase and then applies the best one at checkout and then second if you're creating a shopping list and something is out of stock or you're like waiting for it to come down in price to something you like add it to Karma and it will actually notify you when it's back or when there's a price change it's super easy and then lastly is karma cash so you can get cash back at thousands of stores and then once you earn enough you can cash out with your PayPal account so if you install it now they're giving a special offer where you'll get double the karma cash at signups so get $10 instead of five for a limited time so the links Below in the video description if you want to check that out anyway until the next one thanks for watching catch you guys soon peace,"There is no AI - there is AK (knowledge). Can and has been useful for almost 100 years 👍 | it always amuses me how in the generation of ""Transformative work"" where literally millions of creators borrow copyright material to make their own content such as YT videos, people get so bent out of shape about an AI model which samples artwork. Apparently it's ok for thousands of artists to draw each others work to make videos but as soon as a statistical model includes their work in a dataset it's a problem. | When the Vsauce brownie kicks in 😂😂 | Ai is going to take over creatives role and make them jobless? Let’s be more realistic and narrow it down to creative jobs within the digital media. I have a hard time believing that Ai is going to take over live stage performances. Likewise, how can Ai replicate artwork based on natural media such as oil, charcoal and granite? This only means we creatives will leave our lives behind a computer screen and come back to what real art is all about anyway. | This was amazing man, the way you talk is so charismic. | To be honest, in the first 2 minutes I started to get bored cause I thought the stuff marques says are generic and contributes nothing to the video (usually I don't get bored in marques' videos) then he said it was written by AI. Not suprised actually | ""Artists don't consent for their art to be used"" 
Yeah, no. We don't have rules about learning from other people's art. You can't sell another person's drawings as yours, but you can learn to imitate their style and color palette and shapes. You are allowed to draw a picture of a Batman and the only way you can do this is by learning from existing Batman drawings. 
This is what AI does. It doesn't copy. It doesn't steal. It learns. 
And that is allowed. | Creativity is one of the last things AI will conquer. 
It will sooner replace technical skills like programming or drawing accurate shapes or making automated translation that sounds human. 
But creativity stems from human experience. And that would be the last thing to go. 
I dabble in AI art. People who say it isn't art are stupid. The amount of artistic choices, tweaks and references I need to make to get a good picture is significant. The difference between slop that you can generate in 5 minutes just from a prompt and a refined image is night and day.
AI is at the moment just a tool like Photoshop. People used to hate digital art and call it ""not a real art"" in 1990s and early 2000s. It changed. The attitude to AI art will change as well. 
The reason people hate it is because generating slop became easy. 3 years ago artists charged $50 for a generic character drawing on an empty background with simple shading. Now they can't, and that makes them upset. But what you need to recognize is that is a very low-quality work that was overpriced AF.
At the same time take best digital artists - and AI is not Even close. I am not sure if you can create a piece of artwork that is comparable with a commercial artist from a big studio. It is 80/20 rule. We got 80% of the way now and a lot of people who just want a drawing of their character are very happy with it. But if you want a production quality concept art - You will have to hire an artist. And that will be true for the next decade or two at least, at which point robots and AI will replace 60% of our jobs anyway and there will be ways to survive without a job. | he is being watched by the mac | How on earth is AI generation violating copyright? The whole point of art and creative work is to express yourself freely as you want no matter what style the type of art has. 

Just because your art has a very similar or basically even identical inspired style to someone else's art it is not at all wrong. 

Even with music it's the same: Imagine you just naturally have almost the same voice as Drake or you're an impersonator and create music where your voice sounds exactly like Drake this should never be copyrighted because it's created by you from scratch and is unique, it's not as if you leak confidential audio recordings of the real Drake and publish them without his consent because in the other case it's your own unique content and you don't even have to use the same name of a popular person or existing trade marked company name and can just call the artist name Dake instead of Drake for example.

Just because an AI isn't human it doesn't make it different. AI is literally based on the same nature or brains work with neural networks and is doing the exact same thing like a human: copying work from others ""in their brains"" and recreating it.

No one owns a voice tone or type of art style, that's the whole point of art in my opinion to freely express yourself and everything against this is oppressing that.

That are just greedy people in my opinion who don't care about that and just want to suck out money out of everything.

If you're inspired by Picasso's art style and draw exactly like him or have the exact same voice like Drake that's perfectly fine and doesn't mean you're not allowed to make music just because your voice sounds like Drake, no matter if you're a human, dog or AI.

This whole legal debacle should've long been easily eliminated because of this basic common sense in my opinion."
u2mUpkApObk,My Tech Hot Takes!,Feathers may be ruffled. That shirt: http://shop.MKBHD.com Intro Track: Jordyn Edmonds https://lnk.to/jordynedmonds Playlist of ...,2022-12-04T17:39:41Z,2975508,138905,8590,[Music] foreign [Music] coming at you from the basement Studio we're back uh this is clearly not your regularly scheduled programming um fortunately I'm cooped up here because I finally caught covid two years or I should say kovid finally caught me two years in uh don't worry not to worry I'm fine I've actually long recovered I'm just waiting to test negative a few times in a row before I go back into the studio trying to be smart and safe about it but while I am cooped up down here I'm just kind of like there's not much around so I can't do much with the typical Studio stuff what can I do and my idea that I had was I'm gonna share some uh some opinions that I have that could be considered hot takes some spicy hot takes for you real things that I actually believe at the end of 2022. so I haven't done this before this might this might ruffle some feathers obviously I think we've sort of done a little bit of this on the waveform podcast probably a little more actually on the studio Channel I remember we had a segment where we all gave our our Tech hot takes uh but you know forgive the production quality this is me and a camera and a Yeti mic which is not even meant to be held like this I just happen to have this mic here while I'm home so anyway uh we'll see if y'all agree with me or not on any of this stuff but let's uh let's just jump right into it so number one for me crypto investing is basically all just gambling so look look I know I'm the I'm supposed to be the tech person I'm very optimistic typically about technology and so I'm always trying to see uh the potential future of web3 and nfts and the blockchain and and Bitcoin and ethereum and all this stuff uh but I'd still consider myself a skeptic because it's so hard to see through all of the noise is what I think is a charitable way of calling it so much noise I actually got asked recently on Dr Mike's podcast and it was funny that's like one of the first times I've actually been asked publicly about crypto in a while but he asked me about what I think about it and here's what I said how involved or interested are you in the nft space or crypto space as close to zero as you can be without being zero I have to like keep an eye on it but I have so much skepticism in like me too every time something gets pitched in the inbox or in person or I see anything it always just defaults to how much money you can make and I need to know some other benefits yes yes anything tangible like how useful it'll be I've seen a little bit some whisperings here and there about like maybe the deed of your house will be an nft one day maybe I don't know I have a safe with a deed in it I feel like an old person when I say this but like I'm skeptic I'm a thousand percent with you yeah and that is still for me a hundred percent true do I own some crypto still yeah I do how much doesn't really matter because I can't use it for anything I mean you do see the headlines once in a while right every once in a while a couple months you'll see a headline about a new business that's like starting to accept Bitcoin or ethereum or some crypto or something like that I remember Tesla did this briefly and then they stopped and I was like that headline surfaces every couple months and I notice it and I wait for the Fallout and the continuation but it just never happens and so basically what's happened is all of this promise of like this decentralized world of the future of crypto and nfts and all this stuff it's it's just promise for me and it's all been reduced to like when I open my inbox and I see a new crypto pitch every single time it's just about how much money you can make if you invest if you buy the price goes up and then you make money but what else what other reasons I need other reasons so I'll continue to hold the the Bitcoin that I have it's fine it's not even that much but I think for me if I can't explain why something is more valuable other than lots of people are interested in it right now so it's kind of hot so the value is up there's nothing else to it then uh it's as good as gambling to me so okay number two my number two hot take um is actually just that Tick Tock and YouTube can and will co-exist they'll both be completely fine now maybe this is just a little less spicy than the others but I mean every time I get asked about Tick Tock one of the biggest questions I hear a lot is like should YouTube be worried you know the massive massive rise of tick tock over the past few years especially with the pandemic has been gargantuan you feel like it's unavoidable that this overlap that that Tick Tock just comes up and just starts eating YouTube's lunch but I think the key thing still for YouTube and and Tick Tock is they are such different use cases that they don't overlap at all I mean a tiny bit maybe of your time but almost not at all on YouTube what's this a YouTube video right you go to YouTube to sit down and actually spend some time watching a video that you either searched for or was recommended to you on the homepage and you chose it to watch it you spend more time per her video on YouTube it's got a whole search engine attached to it so you'll find videos based on what you're interested in and and Tick Tock is like I'll sit down and I'll have like two minutes or something and you'll just open it up and scroll a few times and then close it and that's it you just get that quick dopamine burst that quick adrenaline boost that instant gratification and you never actually choose the videos you want to watch it just gets sort of served to you so it kind of reminds me of like YouTube and Netflix YouTube is the world's online video library but Netflix while it is technically also an online video library is different and you expect different things in different places and so they can coexist and that's totally fine that's why I think tick tock's also just going to have a huge separate pie it's not taking a slice of YouTube's pie it's just a new pie and I think with YouTube Shorts YouTube responded pretty correctly and also offering a competing product to tick tock because you know it is related and I also managed to beat tick tock's monetization model like right off the bat very quickly they offer Revenue sharing as of either right now or they're about to start where Tick Tock is still stuck on the Creator you know pool that everyone draws money from so bottom line they're going to be fine they're separate pies and you can stop asking me that that's not that's not that hot of a take actually okay number three number three regular people don't care about panel gaps they just don't care and that's I'm talking about Tesla right now of course so one of the biggest things you always hear in car reviews when people talk about Tesla and compare it to other cars especially you hear this in the Enthusiast community and in in reviews a lot is oh my God the panel gaps the panel gaps the build quality in this car is terrible the gap between the panel here on the hood and on the door is bigger than this gap between these panels and it's smaller than the gap between these panels it's so inconsistent it's jarring it's a poor build and that's actually true that's actually true about Tesla's cars they're much less consistent than the manufacturers who have been established and who have learned to refine their processes over the past 50 hundred plus years but this to me reminds me of I'm sure there's an equivalent in the smartphone world where like reviewers notice this maybe it's like refresh rate on screens I don't know reviewers notice this and really care about it and harp on it a lot but guess what at the end of the day people are still buying Teslas and it's just because the the panel gaps are so low on the list of things that you think about when you're buying a car that it happens to still be fine like this is similar with McLaren McLaren is notorious for obviously other electrical issues and build quality issues but McLarens are all these beautiful hand-built sports cars and you often will see sizable gaps sizable differences in panel gaps on McLarens but guess what people still love their McLarens because that is really far down on the list on why someone was looking at and thinking about buying a 765lt but the thing is I want Tesla to get better at this like having panel gaps is not good in your cars and they've had all kinds of notorious build quality issues in the past as they've aged they got out of building in a tent and they've been working towards improving on their way to the likes of the German manufacturers and the others uh how do you how do you get around this and I think really I look at it like this this is how I look at it right now if you could buy a model 3 but you had to trade some other feature from the model 3 from a different car that's really well built like okay Tesla Model 3 versus Mustang Mach e you could have a Tesla Model 3 with perfect panel gaps everything about the build quality of the car looks like it was built by Ford but you have to trade something with the Ford you trade Tesla's supercharger Network and you get Ford's public open access charger Network we would you take that Tesla no actually I wouldn't because obviously the supercharger network is a huge part of why people end up buying a Tesla so okay what about you get the perfect Tesla Model 3 but you get the Ford's software and would you take that no I think most people still would probably take the Tesla with the panel gaps and you just keep going down the list would you take the Tesla Model 3 with no panel gaps but trade something else about it you find performance is it the tires is it the paint something something else about it and I think what you'll find is that most people will take the Tesla as is with its current set of features so basically I think Tesla Tesla's done the math and they will continue to focus on the things that they believe are reasons why people do buy their cars so differentiating themselves on the Battery Technology on the drivetrains on supercharger Network for that matter on their software on all these other things and the second that panel gaps and Manufacturing issues meaningfully impact their bottom line then and only then will they make a large concerted effort towards changing that because I think in the meantime they're just going to slowly improve in the background and just as they make more cars they'll get better at it now when I do get around to reviewing my Tesla while I point out the panel gaps sure but I don't think most people are there to see all right here's my last hot take last one is that 5G sucks 5G sucks right now 5G is actually worse than 4G do you remember the promise of 5G 5G was supposed it was going to be this amazing thing with this world changing future we're gonna have blazing fast internet in the palms of our hands everywhere we go and it's gonna there's gonna be no latency anywhere there's going to be doctors doing robot surgery halfway around the world with these magic gloves that connect via 5G like all this crazy stuff was going to be promised nobody would ever wait for the buffering of a YouTube video ever again and we'd have the metaverse would finally be real all these promises of 5G and it's turned out yet none of that's happened none of that's true yet now not even that is the hot take I know that you know we understand that it takes time to build the infrastructure and it's just not here yet like I did a video a couple years ago now on the state of 5G and what that meant and I would go up to a cell phone tower and I would get actually one gigabit per second down but then you'd walk around the corner or behind a tree and you'd get fractions of that speed and it's like okay clearly you need a ton of those antennas to cover the entire world for that to be a real possibility in the future and there's no way that happens quickly that's going to require billions and trillions of dollars so yeah we're not there yet okay we get it what I'm trying to say is 5G right now is worse than 4G it's slower it's less consistent and it's more expensive I think we've seen a lot of carriers especially here in the US for example we've got T-Mobile Verizon at T A lot of them especially at T are using the low band 5G not even mid band and low band 5G can actually feel slower than 4G right now and on top of that there's all these weird shenanigans that they play with like the status bar in your phone I've seen on the iPhone like 4G 4G plus 5G 5ge 5G plus uwb all these weird titles and none of them are particularly encouraging I'll get a 5G logo in the corner of my phone I'll do a speed test it'll be slower than 4G so 5G at this Point has really just turned into a thing that smartphone manufacturers can point at and be like look our phones are new is this something that we did that's different from last year but really all it's ended up doing is making our phones more expensive because those radios are more expensive making our battery lives worse because now if you don't have 5G it's switching back and forth and 5G is radio and Battery consuming and making our phone plans more expensive all at once while giving us not that much of a good experience so 5G sucks right now I think also expectations are the thief of joy and 5G really sucks because the expectations and the promises were like way up here and we're nowhere near that yet 5G is brutally bad uh hopefully that changes I want to be an optimist I hope a lot of these things change to be honest but yeah those are my those are my hot takes right now here's another hot take we have the best merch in the entire YouTube game I'm wearing the parallelogram sweatshirt right now shop.nbhd.com as I wear the maddian shirt right over it now I uh that's a that's not a hot take everyone knows we have the best stuff but anyway that's been it let me know what you think I promise the next video will be back to your regularly scheduled programming I hope to be in the studio soon fun episode of the podcast just went up check that out but in the meantime I will see you guys in the next one Bass [Music],"4:20 well this aged well | I still have a OnePlus 7T without 5g and I really don't have any problems with 4g | A year later and 5G still stinks. Sometimes yeah it's pretty fast, but then you go indoors and it becomes absolutely worthless. I had to constantly force my Pixel 7 to switch to LTE when in certain areas. I'm on an iPhone 16 now and it seems to be better about switching to LTE when 5g is in its worthless state. Comparing when you're on 5G normal or 5G UC or UW is like comparing dial-up to broadband, yet they are all 5G! | Panel gaps are a quality control issue 😂 it's objectively a bad thing whether or not normal people care or notice | I think the benefit of bitcoin is mostly political, like if you are worried about the national debt or not. | my 5g can download FH5 ten times over in just a couple of hours | 5g in india has been for past 2 years giving 800mbps and any youtube video including 4k works without buffering and if that can happen in india so it can happen in usa | 5G SUCKS STIL IN 2025 | Nice Madeon Adventure jacket | We need more of these videos.

O_WbmIIy4vk,iPad Pro M2: What Does &quot;Pro&quot; Even Mean?,Don't let this distract you from the fact that the iPad Pro is still... really good MKBHD Merch: http://shop.MKBHD.com Damascus is ...,2022-11-18T21:48:49Z,3544938,109523,3866,oh yeah nice iPad Pro oh yeah yeah this is the new one too oh neat I I heard about that what is that what does anyone do well you know um it's got that it it's more of the same uh [Music] hey what's up HD here and this is the new new iPad Pro um you couldn't really tell from the outside because it is exactly the same as the one we got with the M1 chip a year and a half ago it is the same excellent display the sweet promotion mini LED on the 12.9 inch version and led on the 11 inch it's the same usb-c port with Thunderbolt the same battery same stereo speakers same webcam placement same second gen apple pencil support literally from the outside you cannot tell it is a new one unless you know that this little bit of text on here that says iPad Pro at the bottom it used to just say iPad before so that's new okay okay I got it I got it this one it has the new M2 Chip inside instead of the M1 oh tight so like I can do more stuff right well no it does the same stuff but faster again it's the same iPad but it has an M2 Chip inside now instead of the old M1 from a year and a half ago which to a logical person would imply that this one is capable of something that the old M1 version wasn't capable of and technically yes so the M1 chip was already ludicrously over the top fast for an iPad very powerful the M2 is another bump up to that so in raw performance you're looking at 10 to 15 faster CPU and 30 to 40 faster Graphics all with the same battery life it's just silly at this point uh it's it's also still running iPad OS 16 that every previous iPad is also running but this iPad has more raw horsepower than a lot of mid-range and higher end laptops even more than Apple's own M1 iMac so yeah if there was some theoretical application that you were running on your iPad and the M1 just wasn't up to the task it just wasn't powerful enough to handle it then this M2 iPad May finally be able to handle that just kidding that's probably not a real scenario but this will shorten the time of some exports of your absolute largest video or 3D projects you're doing on the iPad oh you know what else this version has Wi-Fi 6E 60 what six e so it so so this one's it's going to be a little more future proof a little faster which is kind of cool I guess I don't know you know what else though what prores video this one can shoot it's capable of shooting Perez video that I think I heard about that sounds pretty cool can I see so uh so I'd have to download another app to show you which I don't have right now um but it is capable of it yeah you might have seen on Apple's site and in their marketing materials that prores video capture is one of the new features but it's actually not in the stock camera app like if you were just getting this iPad just to make it your mobile video Studio like in the commercials first of all I don't know if we could be friends but hey if that's you you do you you get this iPad you take it out the box you fire it up and you open up the camera settings like I did you won't find prores in there because it's not supported by Apple's own iPad camera app so you require a third-party app like filmic Pro for that video Studio oh probably the biggest new feature is the pencil hover uh right mine does not do that exactly so that's exclusive to the M2 for some reason but yeah it's the new one so basically when you get the apple pencil close to the iPad screen within 12 millimeters it'll show you a preview of what you're about to do so similar to some other professional Wacom tablets you basically get a little preview of what's about to happen when you put the pen to the screen and then you actually do it so if you're about to hit an icon or a widget on the home screen it'll show that and if you're about to paint or write something it can show that and then even if you're doing some watercolor brushes in the notes app not only does it show where the brush stroke will be but it shows you a mix of what two colors would look like if you painted on top of each other but then you can also adjust the size of the brush stroke with a pinch with one hand while you move the pen around with the other it's pretty sick actually so this works across iPad OS and all Apple's apps and then even some third-party apps now are also starting to take advantage of this hover thing So pixelmator Pro for example will show previews of Applied effects and filters on a hover so it's great now again I don't know if this would have been impossible to do with the M1 chip but they didn't so yeah that's the difference but then that's it it's their best iPad ever by the small amount of the new chip prores video Wi-Fi 60 and hover which you know got me thinking all the existential questions again of like what is this product even why is this iPad so ridiculously powerful what what is an iPad Pro like in 99 of use cases regular people will never be able to tell the difference between an M1 iPad Pro and an M2 iPad Pro that doesn't mean they shouldn't have made it it's still better but that's cool but maybe maybe in those last one percent the real pros will be able to notice and feel the difference and they should definitely get this one over the refurbished M1 iPad Pro but who what is that one percent who what is an iPad Pro user what is a pro iPad user and really that just zooms me out to their bigger question what does pro mean in Apple's lineups because they use that word a lot I went through every single product that Apple sells right now that has the word Pro in the name and it turns out there's really two definitions two buckets of what Pro is one is what you would think Pro is which is professional which is people who actually make money from using a certain product and that money helps them pay for it it's just a professional relationship you're a pro user of that product and the other is an enthusiastic user who likes the high-end version so this is how I divide it up in their current lineup now also these aren't super rigid lines I think you could make some arguments You could argue that some people take enough phone calls on their airpods Pro that they are pro airpods users and there's plenty of MacBook Pro users also who just had money to burn and wanted the one with the nicer screen they just got the more expensive one and there's definitely a professional colorist already down in the comments typing away that the pro display xdr isn't a real editing display so you know we can we can bend these lines for sure but the iPad to me still feels like the the blurriest mix of them all maybe it's just because I know a lot of these people but there's clearly a lot of enthusiastic users but there are also lots of professionals making the iPad Pro work for their workflow maybe they're bending it around the iPad a little bit but there's lots of people using pixelmator and procreate and The DaVinci Resolve app is coming to the iPad soon so that's real hardcore excellent apps that people are making money with and using for their work but then at the same time like our graphic designer Tim here would probably probably laugh at the idea of using an iPad instead of the Wacom tablet and also I'm a video editor and as powerful as this iPad is I can't use Final Cut Pro on the iPad Pro still so I guess all this is to say it doesn't really mean anything don't put yourself into a bucket the word Pro really is is clearly just used to sell you on something and to make you feel like you're getting the best thing and professionals like nice things so I would like the pro thing too and of course some other companies still use different words uh Samsung and xiaomi love Ultra for example some others still use the word plus but my bottom line on this new iPad Pro with M2 is if you're someone going iPad shopping yes this is now the best iPad you can get and it's phenomenal it's really really good but also if you think about how exactly you're going to be using this iPad and prores video Never crosses your mind drawing with the pencil isn't on your list you can basically have this exact same experience for 300 off already at this point by getting an M1 I'd like to think that we're in for possibly a bigger iPad Pro update soon in the future things like adding the webcam to the long side instead of the short side where it stayed for so many years or you know more meaningful things like a display Improvement battery improvements speaker improvements camera updates to the latest sensors things like that they could all happen but until then I'm going to keep using my nearly three-year-old a12z iPad Pro that does all the same stuff that I want out of an iPad Pro but without the newest chip don't let this distract you from the fact that the iPad is still an incredible tablet by far one of my favorite tablets ever made but if the iPad Pro's potential could please present itself that'd be great until then the Paradox of iPad Pro prevails thanks for watching catch you the next one [Music],"If I can code on the Ipad pro, I might buy one instead of using mac | if you have no ipad get the newest

4yjRIcRc9qY,Lucid Air: How to One-up Tesla!,Lucid Air beats Tesla's flagship at almost everything you can win at. Except one thing Auto Focus channel: ...,2022-11-11T19:27:05Z,5902059,157615,7668,love me [Music] so there are a lot of different ways to enter the electric car market with your first try from the established manufacturers and from the startups so like Ford's first mainstream EV was a sedan and then Tesla's first one was actually a sports car but then rivian's first one was a pickup truck and so that's why I find these so interesting so I've already started to have a lot of fun with these different high-tech cars over on the new autofocus Channel shot exclusively on smartphones link with a like button of course but that is why Lucid has been so interesting to me because it seems to me that their strategy at least from the outside looking in is to just one-up Tesla at everything that they possibly can so okay this is Tesla's Flagship the model S and this is lucid's air Grand Tour I'm a capera but if you just listen to the basics on paper right the Lucid has much much more range 446 miles on a single charge from this air GT performance it has faster charging 350 kilowatts Max it has a thousand plus horsepower it's got stickier tires it's more luxurious inside got my attention [Music] so okay Tesla's Interiors were never really anything to write home about but I can say that this is a they did a really good job this interior from Lucid one UPS pretty much everything about Tesla's interior there are better materials everywhere with leather on things that you touch the Alcantara headliner there's a little bit of dry wood trim and overall fit and finish of everything in here is excellent it is a quieter inside cabin both while sitting and while driving and the seats are all better with much more adjustment there's multi-zone Heating and Cooling that turns on and is effective super fast I noticed and they even have several massage programs which I never really use in any car but every time I see it you know you just get the feeling that it's a little bit extra luxurious and then the back seat experience is way better so just as a reminder the backseat of a Model S is pretty good right I have a 6'3 driving position and then another 6'3 passenger and my leg room's all right headroom's pretty good from the glass roof some decent quality materials around me and then in the middle I have a wireless charger a cup holder and a screen to control the air conditioning but this is lucid's standard backseat first of all the door now opens fully 90 degrees low-key a really nice feature but then there's just dramatically more legroom and space because they opted for a normal trunk instead of a hatchback so they've moved in the same wheelbase as a Tesla this seat way further backs now I have more space I have dedicated HVAC controls there's no wireless charger in the middle but there is a cup holder and a screen for the air conditioning and some more storage but it's just much more luxurious there is Storage in the back of the seats there is access to the trunk in between the two seats if you take down that armrest there's also an option in this car for you to take a little bit of battery out of the floor for a little bit more footwell room plus you can't forget about those executive seat options from the Prototype I tested five whole years ago but wait there is more I've been living this car for about a week now and I there's just so many things to it first of all the sound system is actually incredible it has 21 speakers and they support you know Spotify and things like that but also tidal Hi-Fi in the UI and I swear I came home from a drive and I just sat and listened to the Dolby Atmos speakers for a while and it just sounds so good incredibly immersive there's also a better steering wheel in here with stocks and real buttons and I think these knobs are a great idea they're plastic but there's no creaking or give to them and they work great for selecting things or scrolling I like the wheel there's also a more impressive windshield that curves up over the driver's head if you're into that with some pretty sick ambient lighting strips through the middle that glows softly at night the tint in the roof is really good it also just kind of acts like a normal roof line but you can see things through it and there are better HVAC controls in this car thanks to real buttons and that knob in the middle is just a big volume knob but the center console storage is really unique it includes this this whole screen that tilts back and reveals some hidden storage space behind it where you could keep some sunglasses or a mask or whatever I don't know but probably most impressively the Lucid has a much larger powered opening and closing front that's thanks to this wider shape and then the smaller overall Motors in the front so this is a massive and very useful front trunk that I'm tempted to use way more than the rear trunk itself and then there is the software so it would be really hard to one-up Tesla software considering that's like the most impressive part of their car but lucid's gonna try and so they don't support Android auto or apple carplay just like Tesla they've built their own UI and it's pretty bold and it has to be really good I would say it is yeah it's pretty good so you've got two screens here this big one behind the wheel with a touchscreen sensitive area on either side and this second one down in between the seats and the layout here is smart they actually give you a front opening instead of a trunk opening which makes me want to use it more but generally the UI in here is intuitive and fairly fast not necessarily smooth all the time as far as frame rates but it's fast but this is by the way the 2.0 version of the software they had a bunch of 1.x versions that were much slower this version is more well laid out than before and faster than before and there's lots of useful features like it's got this top down view in here for parking that Tesla still for some reason doesn't provide but it has this and a 360 surround version that shows the car you're driving and the environment around it from various angles and it actually matches your spec here unlike Porsches but you know there are definitely some quirks too the weirdest part to me is that you can't see music and maps at the same time at least I haven't been able to figure out how if I want music up here I hit music but then it also adds music on the bottom screen but if I want want maps on the top screen I hit Maps but then it switches the bottom screen to Maps too so I want music one place Maps the other place but the nice thing is it's just software and software is one of those things that can improve over time and this is one of those cars that's actually gotten meaningful software updates over time which is great to see but there's one other thing that this car does really well and that is Drive [Music] so something I've realized that is a little underrated and doesn't get talked about enough in cars is Cars that have like multiple personalities plural a personality is nice but being able to switch between being a sporty car and being a luxurious chill car is nice so we can't ignore the fact this is a big sedan so there are three personalities Drive modes in the settings here smooth Swift and Sprint so smooth is great when you have passengers you know it's got the gentlest acceleration curve and regen the lightest steering and the softest suspension potholes aren't a huge problem it still does have 21 inch wheels so it's not the smoothest but I find that the regen and one pedal driving calibration on the Lucid is great you almost never have to touch the friction brakes if you don't want to I do think if this had 19-inch Wheels it would make a bigger difference to the ride quality than just the suspension setting here but this is about as good as you can do with the 21s so as you get sportier everything gets a little bit lower a little bit heavier a little bit firmer if you go all the way to Sprint that is the car's lowest most responsive and firmest setting so now I'm going to feel all the bumps but that's what you want when it's feeling more like a sports car now it's not a sports car right you can't exactly mask this car's 5 000 plus pounds of weight but it does I will say it feels lighter than it actually is it has this level of mechanical grip it's not Arrow it's just this the big tires and the mechanical grip that gives you a confidence in an all-wheel drive car this is really confidence inspiring car to drive oh and then it happens to have a thousand horsepower so yeah I will say though versatile car legitimately three different personalities for a car that costs this much money I would want to be able to decouple the different modes and things that come with changing between Sprint and Swift and smooth so like I for example would really like to have the Swift acceleration but the smoother suspension but you can't decouple the suspension from the acceleration it's just three big buttons so it's cool if you have a passenger you just hit the smooth button then everything's smooth and pillow like and luxurious and that's pretty ideal I like that mode but yeah if I want to play with a little bit for this price I should be able to now luckily that is a software thing so there's a good chance that someday I will be able to but I gotta say I am very impressed with the way this car drives and changes the way that it drives this is the thing you always hear when people review certain supercars they're like wow it seems to be very daily drivable I wouldn't expect that from a car with all this horsepower and this is the opposite it's a big heavy luxurious smooth quiet sedan and when you put it in Sprint mode and you really play with it it kind of has that oh I did not expect it to grip this well and have all this traction and really fire out of corners but it it does so when I first drove this car the Lucid air prototype like five years ago that had this crazy executive seat option which I don't think it should be in any of them now but the point was that's a car you'd want to be driven in more than actually drive there's some cars like that this one because they've gotten all the other factors right in the steering and handling and the sportiness and the thousand horsepower I can actually say this is a car I'd be equally happy driving or being driven in and that's an accomplishment but the other thing I wanted to know after that is okay they've showed the nice prototype but when they ship it will it actually get the 400 plus miles that it's supposed to on a charge and now that I've driven it with the range estimates and the efficiency I can actually say yes you are able to get 400 to 430 miles on a single charge on this car's battery but you know what this car is not perfect no car is perfect obviously but I think for me actually what it really comes down to is mostly nitpicking because there's so many good things about this car I just don't like the way it looks that's just me maybe this is a hot take I've seen some comments from people saying like oh this is the best looking Eevee out right now they smoked everyone else in the Aesthetics Department I disagree I like the interior a lot I just don't like the way the car looks from the outside let me explain but I think what it comes down to for me is the two-tone thing and the shape of the back of the car the two-tone thing this car has these huge not Chrome but big silver pieces on it giving it this two-tone look with the body color I think they just tried to copy my buck which is like you see a two-tone Maybach and you know that that's luxury but this one kind of ends up looking like an older Lincoln if I'm not mistaken I don't know there is a stealth package that lets you like matte black these out it's six thousand dollars but then this is the back of the car back here and because they decided to go with the regular trunk and not a hatchback you end up with much more rear seat luxury and that's great but then you also end up with this like bulbous shape back here I get why they did it they still have a trunk and aerodynamics but now it doesn't look as good to me the mouth of it when it opens looks kind of funny because it's this huge piece that has to open and then the opening technically is a pretty good amount of trunk space but I just went to Lowe's the other day and bought a flower pot don't ask why but I had a flower pot and even that was hard to fit in this small of an opening so the trunk suffers a little bit and the Arrow does benefit but that's how you end up with this back of the car and that's why I think I'm not the biggest fan of the aesthetic but really overall I think Luca actually does a really good job of one-upping Tesla and a lot of those key ways that people really think about and that matters in an EV now unfortunately you can probably see where this is going that also means they are more expensive across the lineup the whole thing this Grand Touring spec that I'm in starts starts at a hundred and fifty four thousand dollars and then we all know the flagship right now for Tesla is the model S plaid they're actually coming out with a Sapphire version of this car not supposed to come out next year to match the triple motor powertrain and guess what it one-ups Tesla at everything again it's faster zero to 60 faster zero to 100 faster in the quarter mile comes with carbon ceramic breaks by by default it has a stealth package 520 miles of range and will have all the same advantages I just talked about in luxury it's basically the Plaid plus that never came out that Tesla never made but guess what it's 250 000 so you know this is a new company they haven't made a lot of cars yet but what they're doing is starting at their most expensive highest margin versions of the cars and then working their way down I wouldn't be surprised if the Sapphire version came out long before the Lucid air pure which is the rear-wheel drive base model for 87 000 comes out someday in the future but that's their strategy and that's so far made a pretty sweet car but when you only tackle Tesla's top trims might be trending towards trouble thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace,"I came for the car I’m distracted by your look. You are gorgeous ❤ Nice presentation. | Great review 
I will drive this at the end of my current lease | I looked at the Tesla and the Lucid and to me there is no comparison. The Lucid hands down is the way better vehicle. Tesla is inferior on so many levels. Have decided to buy the Lucid Sapphire the 1st of next month | Fast forward....can pick them up for almost 50% depreciation in less than a year old car. | Amazing car
I live the look and style
Awesome all around | I thought the point of EV was to be cheaper than gas vehicles, $150.000 - $250.000...this is nuts. | The shape of the back, definitely ! | MAN!!! The second he said 'the outside isn’t that good,' I almost hit the pause button out of pure disbelief! 😅 Lucid's design is sleek, futuristic, and turning heads everywhere—let's not pretend otherwise! But hey, everyone's got their opinion... even if it's questionable 👀🔥 What do y’all think? Love it or nah? | BROWNLEE!!! WADDUP. love your work. | anf then you look at the price of this vs model 3 or y and u go back lmao"
I1qsF0WQy8c,Dear Twitter!,I can see you're going through a lot. But I have some suggestions. Me: http://twitter.com/MKBHD That shirt!: http://shop.,2022-11-08T02:29:45Z,4694255,195224,12481,[Music] hey what's up I'm Kim BHD here so I really like Twitter okay this comes from a place of love but when you really like something you want to see it succeed so I've been on Twitter for 13 plus years I've tweeted over 50 000 times don't judge me but I use several different Twitter apps I have third party apps on my phone I've already made a dear Twitter video this was five years ago and actually some of the suggestions that I made in that video including the ability to edit tweets now has actually made it to the product which is kind of amazing but I don't know if you guys have heard but Twitter they're kind of going through a lot right now so Elon Musk has actually bought Twitter and taken over leadership very quickly and a lot of pretty drastic changes are being made very quickly reorganizing the whole company firing people unfiring people tons of new feature suggestions are on the table honestly it feels like anything is on the table so from the outside looking in it just looks like complete chaos even if you're on Twitter it's chaos but I just I want it to work like I want Twitter to be good I I don't know I'm one of those sickos that actually enjoys spending time on Twitter sometimes and maybe it's kind of hard to explain why but Twitter feels like it's a pretty unique social media platform it's an it's a unique experience because it actually makes everyone feel reachable like it actually has a pretty small user base as far as daily active users Facebook has literally 10 times the amount of active users Twitter literally has less daily active users than Snapchat right now but it does feel like it has an outsized impact relative to that number of people like there are a ton of interesting people personalities athletes politicians celebrities musicians artists all over Twitter and it's just like it feels like if you could just reach out to any one of them they might see it and reply back it just happens all the time so anyway I'm rooting for Twitter to do well but with all the chaos going on right now there's most people do not have that level of confidence in them at all now a few days ago I tweeted that YouTube is in fact still the only true s-tier social media platform to which Elon immediately replied for now so you know what I'm just going to take you at face value here I'm going to assume and believe that you actually want Twitter to be an A plus amazing great social media platform so I'm just gonna tell you what I think Twitter should do to actually achieve that and this is just coming from my years of experience on social media Elon currently follows me on Twitter maybe he'll see this maybe I can actually make this a useful video now to be clear I don't think Twitter becomes an s-tier social media platform by just aping YouTube or by you know becoming a direct YouTube competitor it should still be its own thing but as imperfect as it is there's a lot of things that YouTube does really well and there's a reason I put it as s tier and there's a reason the same reason that a lot of people who blow up on a different social media platform from Vine to tick tock to Instagram to Twitter nine times out of ten their next move is to try to convert as much of that as possible to a YouTube channel so here's a little diagram I made this is what I'll call The Virtuous cycle of the YouTube Creator ecosystem it's oversimplified but obviously many creators on YouTube use outside tools but the basic premise is there's a lot of creators on YouTube and those creators are making content contributing to the world's largest online video library YouTube builds monetization Tools around those videos which in turn gets creators paid and happy which gets them making more content etc etc it just keeps flowing in a circle now I don't know exactly how much Elon knows about YouTube monetization specific typically are the tools that they've built I'm again just going to go by face value here but it's also a legitimately hard business question If you're trying to build something like that cycle where do you jump in like Twitter doesn't necessarily have YouTube style massive library of content but what it does have is a lot of really interesting high profile creative users so dear Twitter a suite of evolving Creator tools would make a massive difference to the entire website so over the years YouTube has added things from all over the place there's the YouTube Partner program so our advertisers pay for spots alongside YouTube videos and YouTube shares 55 of that ad Revenue with the uploader of the video they also recently announced monetized shorts even more Revenue sharing in the shorts feed starting next year they also have super thanks which puts a donation button under a video that makes your comment distinct and colorful and creators receive 70 of that donated money they also have super chats and super stickers during live streams so viewers can pay to have their chats highlighted creators also keep 70 of that money and there's Channel memberships where you can offer exclusive content to a smaller group of paid subscribers or members and the Creator again get 70 percent of that money now Twitter actually has some of this stuff already I think basically super follows are like the equivalent of Channel memberships and Twitter actually beats the percentage by a mile Twitter will give 97 of the revenue of a paid follower to that Creator on Twitter up to 50 Grand and then it's 80 after that that's still really good but they really could use more of these things like just how YouTube has copied a lot of these features from other platforms Twitter should also feel free to adapt a lot of these things for its own platform like I keep thinking back to remembering like Periscope and live streaming when that was happening a lot more often that was really solid and that should have been more easily monetized and while you can upload videos to twitter ads and revenue sharing aren't really a thing for the masses but they totally could be I think they should be imagine you're just a random user who's making videos putting them on Twitter and by chance one of them just pops off and just gets a ton of exposure or gets retweeted by a bunch of people and suddenly that's an nice chunk of change in your pocket that would be pretty incredible and that also incentivizes more uploads of high quality videos to twitter also I saw Elon respond to our boy Quinn on Twitter who mentioned that the YouTube Partner program pays creators 55 and Elon said they can beat that percentage and that sounds great I believe you you've already beat some other percentages from them but if nobody really advertises on your platform then the percentage doesn't really matter does it so that's where we should just get right into talking about it relying on advertisers versus subscriptions so as you've probably noticed by now uh the internet runs on ads it just does like social media platforms revenues generated by advertisers major websites and blogs and things that you read they run on ads like all these big websites and major content places they get their revenue from advertising and as whatever you think about ads like obviously they're annoying sometimes but it just it's what makes the world turn in online media it's just true now these companies are also smart these these social media companies especially are smart because they're trying to introduce more subscription services so that they can reduce their Reliance on ads if you have more subscription services that people actually pay for that's recurring Revenue that's guaranteed every month instead of having to rely on the finicky ad buyer market so Snapchat made Snapchat Plus which is a four dollar a month subscription for some extra custom stories and post settings and notification features meta launched Instagram subscriptions where creators can charge up to 100 bucks a month for exclusive content including stories we even have an MKBHD Discord Channel which is mostly free but now also has premium memberships with extra channels and the thing that all of these successful subscription Services have in common is adding value or at least adding perceived value for the person paying but here's the thing ads still run the internet like as successful as some of these subscription models have been ads are still where the revenue is at here uh here's an example YouTube has 2.6 billion monthly active users it's gigantic right how many of them do you think pay for YouTube premium go ahead yes 2.6 billion total so you get it's 12 bucks a month you get background play you get no ads you get the ability to download stuff for offline how many people you think about 20 million people pay for YouTube premium so that's good money sure but that's you know about 10 of the 28 billion dollars they made in that calendar year so yeah YouTube still runs on ads even Netflix the like grandfather of subscription models for Content they also just recently added in ads here like it's just it feels like 10 is like the magic number of how much revenue you can make with subscriptions if it's a great subscription service but you just make the rest of your money with ads but Twitter you know they really really want to reduce the Reliance on advertisers if they want to completely avoid any potential adpocalypse if they want Twitter to be this free speech Haven that is every advertiser's worst nightmare if they really want to turn the corner on Subscription Service Revenue then they have to make a really good Subscription Service they have to make it full of features that people actually want to pay for you know what I always think back to people pay 30 a month for LinkedIn premium thirty dollars a month that's that's a lot of money but that's because they offer real features that people actually get value from so fun fact many years ago I tweeted uh just off the top of my head a random subscription idea that I had for YouTube this isn't like 2016 and the brilliant name I came up with was YouTube blue and I basically just wanted it to offer faster priority processing for extremely large uploaded files like I would I would totally pay every month as an uploader for priority processing because that's a value to me someone who creates content for YouTube but now many years later we have this thing called Twitter blue great oh it's a subscription service what a coincidence beautiful we should fill it with things that people actually want to pay for so my main request Twitter is putting actual time and effort into thinking of and developing features for Twitter blue that are actually good and worth extra dollars and I think that focusing on the Creator class and power users of Twitter can probably be a really good guidance point for those things so unfortunately the first year of Twitter blue kind of sucked because most of the features weren't really compelling for very many people like you could undo tweets which was kind of stupid but you could also upload longer videos that were up to 1080p now you can actually edit tweets for real which is really cool and it's getting better but think back to all of those Creator tools that we just mentioned earlier and those types of things would be worth way more than eight bucks a month to many people especially people just like me who create a lot of content and things that can just go on Twitter because it unlocks monetization for all types of content and I would pay for itself very quickly I guess what I'm trying to say is having a little verified human check mark next to your name doesn't feel like something that will be worth eight dollars to most people especially because the benefit is to everyone else on the platform and not the person paying so strikes me as something that should probably just be free but this has been really interesting to watch right now there are 400 000 verified users on Twitter so judging from elon's tweets because that's kind of all we have to go by being verified will be one of the features looped into Twitter blue so let's say a hundred percent of them pay eight bucks a month to keep their badge that would be 77 million dollars per year which sounds like a lot but again just to refresh your memory Twitter made about five billion dollars of Revenue last year 92 percent of it was from advertising and so this would just be a drop in the bucket but it sounds like elon's plan is to have everyone pay you know every every real human on Twitter connect a credit card pay eight bucks a month that's their ID and then just keep using Twitter like normal which kind of violates my rule number one of the internet which is you probably can't charge money for something that was previously free I don't think most people are going to want to do that I really think that new value added to Twitter that people would choose to pay for like better features higher quality media I think that's the way there's a whole thread I'll link below of like random ideas someone just came up with and did mock-ups for and some of them are actually really interesting and I could see Twitter power users loving some of that stuff but like the eight bucks a month for a verified human profile it was like guaranteed a negative reaction just because it's new money for something that's not new so in summary I think Twitter blue right now is a pretty weak attempt at getting like as many people as possible to pay for Twitter and I don't think there is any amount of cool features you could add to get most normal people to pay for Twitter what I do think they should focus on is a smaller higher conversion group of power users and creators and then you will need Advertiser Revenue to get into that virtuous cycle so I'll just leave you with this chart again this is what I think success can look like for Twitter like Twitter Twitter is what it is because of the people on Twitter as with any other social media platform like that's just a fact so I think that's where you jump into this cycle by making things features and tools that those people genuinely want and then crafting the rest of the rules and features around the behavior that you want works every time like if posting this 10 minute video on Twitter would cost me eight bucks a month where posting this video on YouTube would actually make me money then it's kind of a no-brainer I'm posting it on YouTube and then I'll put a link on Twitter because that's what the rules and the features incentivize so yeah that's just my two cents and hey maybe maybe elon's serious about not really caring about the economics of Twitter at all in which case that would actually be totally cool but the 44 billion dollars aren't going to pay itself so there you have it thanks for watching I'm rooting for your Twitter catch you in the next one peace [Music],"Elon lived long enough to become villian | Heh.

I feel bad for you after this video, bro expected too much | 9:34 $30 / month for LinkedIn Premium?? I could spend double that on wallpapers for the entire year | I never hear anything good about Twitter. It honestly sounds like somebody's abusive ex they keep running back to... No thanks 👍 | There is only one kind of power users on Twitter, its paid state propagandists. Sad but that is what Elon wants Twitter to be. His personal voice amplifier and tool to influence politics."
f5t2_-HoXb4,iPhone’s Crash Detection vs Roller Coasters,,2022-10-21T05:01:32Z,5218408,381315,2865,9-1-1 what's your emergency not again one of the new features in the iPhones and apple watches this year is called crash detection essentially it can automatically determine if it's been in a car crash and then call emergency services for you so they do this by constantly sampling data from a bunch of sensors so basically if the phone's GPS says you're traveling very quickly and then the gyroscope and accelerometer feels some hard g-forces and then the microphone hears some loud crashing sounds it's pretty sure you've been in a crash so It'll ask you and then call 9-1-1 if you don't respond but you know what else turns out to have almost the exact same set of circumstances happening to you and the phone in your pocket a roller coaster people have been going on theme park rides accelerating fast hitting high g-forces and hearing loud crashing sounds and their phones and watches have picked up on all that and started calling 9-1-1 sending law enforcement over and over again to the Joker roller coaster at Six Flags so that's why you might now start to see signs like this warning you to turn your phone off or put it in Airplane Mode which is kind of hilarious but also Apple please try to fix this one,"How is that apples fault people should turn it off a theme park | Why would anyone go on a rollercoaster with a phone in their pocket ? | How can apple fix this | The whole idea took down by non other than the Joker 🔥 | Idk if this has been fixed by now, but if it’s already using GPS, it should be able to tell when you’re not on a road | classical software design flaw ... of course such a function needs to warn the user of the planned 911 call - the whole watch needs to vibrate violently, sounds need to go off on full volume *AND* it needs to wait for ""at least"" 5 whole minutes before starting the call / signal - maybe even 10 or 15. | Why we bringing phones onto rollercoasters in the first place? | I was in a crash three days ago

It connected me to the police so fast I didn’t even know who was calling me till I answered  😂

Great feature 👍 | Yeah this should be apple’s problem to fix, they are just trying their best 🥺, like the solution @alexvargas1772 sujested, adding some kind of roller coaster mode should be the best option I believe, but if not, really people shouldn’t be taking their time phones on roller coasters | When it detects you at a theme park, a notification should come up asking if you want to turn it off for 4 hours, or all day."
-OpUg0GDrII,Pixel Watch Review: First Gen Fumbles!,The second gen should be much more interesting. Thank you to Rocket Money for sponsoring today's video! Check out ...,2022-10-15T21:34:48Z,3377815,96864,4495,24 7. ah [Music] 24 7. let's talk about this Google pixel watch so the first generation of any uh new piece of tech is always interesting you know this is Google's first pixel Smart Watch we have the Google pixel phones and the pixel Buds and the pixel tablet coming later that could be fun too but yeah this is their first crack at a pixel Smart Watch so I know I'm not the only one who was very curious just waiting for this thing to see what it would look like what features they would include how well it would work together what the design would be and I also know that I'm not the only one who's disappointed in a lot of this stuff let's talk about it so when you first buy a pixel watch for 350 you get a small 41 millimeter circular smart watch it comes in this one size but there's three colors black silver or gold the black being the best in my opinion because it is matte black while the other two are very much glossy and the front glass curves way over into a dome shape made of Gorilla Glass 5. it's like a Sleek little Pebble well not a Pebble Smartwatch but a literal Pebble a very lightweight weight Pebble and there's only two buttons the crown that rotates and pushes in and then a button right above it the crown I think is really good it sticks out enough it's usable everywhere it has haptics when you scroll with it nice and clicky the button above it not so much it's pretty small doesn't have much travel it's still clicky but because of the domed glass it's pushed fairly far back kind of close to your wrist luckily you don't really use it that much and then connecting the watch bands at the top and bottom happens through this clever little push and slide system it's clever I say because it can connect bands in this really seamless looking way without any lugs or bulky connections and the first party watch bands do a really good job of looking like they just jut out of the side of the watch which is pretty cool you might not care about this at all if you never change watch bands but as somebody who changes watch bands every single day to sleep in a different band I just get used to this motion a lot and so I find it good when it's good and this is also something very important to get right in the first generation because you don't really want to have to change it three years in because that makes everyone's watch bands that they just bought for the past three years incompatible so they're trying to keep this for a long time so Hardware wise I think this thing is actually pretty beautiful I love the simple Circle you can easily dress it down and keep it subtle or you can just go sports band or fabric band it seems to fit right into a lot of different places it's stainless steel it's water resistant up to 50 meters and the back happens to be pretty simple too it's just a heart rate sensor blood oxygen sensor and the ECG and up front this is a thousand nit OLED display with a mostly black background through most of the software so it just kind of feels like a black disc floating on your wrist it's nice the only thing I wish is that it was bigger or if there was a larger version so I don't even have that big of a wrist but this thing is just it's pretty small which some people will like but I just wish I had a larger screen this watch is a 41 millimeter watch but that measurement is just of the actual outside of the casing when you actually get a look at this thing the bezels are pretty substantial and so the screen is down to about 29 millimeters across now I don't actually hate these bezels I think it's it's kind of like the notch on a phone you know a lot of people who don't actually use it can make a big deal about it because if you just look at them they look silly but the mostly black background throughout the UI does a good job of hiding them and you really only see them when you're looking for them or if you set a photo as a watch face but I really think a bigger watch would feel even more modern for the computer on the wrist nerds like me and it would also solve the number one problem of this Hardware which is battery life because the battery life is trash it's bad it's it's just not good at all so on stage Google said what did they say up to 24 hours was their claim which probably should have been the first red flag because if you think about it 24 hours is like 8 A.M one day to 8 A.M the next day so one day and one night but that's the maximum it's up to 24 hours so the always-on display is off by default out of the box I turned that on and it's literally measuring your heart rate every single second all day every day every single second that's a lot of heart rate measurements so just for context the Apple watch for example is checking periodically through the day and every five seconds while you're sleeping so now here I'm getting more like 18 hours tops which is not quite enough to go all day and then do a full night of sleep tracking so if you wanted to sleep tracking like me basically you have to charge it twice a day every day sometime in the morning when you wake up and then again sometime in the afternoon before you go to sleep or it's just gonna die if the thing drains about 20 to 25 battery just during one night of sleep tracking now measuring your heart rate every single second to the second is actually kind of sick like it's pretty cool there is a complication they showed it on stage two of just the watch telling you every second updating what your heart rate is like I've never seen anything like it it's the most accurate heart rate tracking I've ever tried in a wearable it's great for tracking workouts heart rate recovery you know this this is the Fitbit prowess going to work no doubt but the other smart watches that are now years in you know the Samsung Galaxy watch 5 and the Apple Watch series 8. they've all realized by this point that the way you save battery is by pinging all these sensors less often like the battery saver mode on the new Apple watch literally is just pinging heart rate and GPS less and turning off things like the always on display and the blood oxygen readings that are going on all the time in the background that's how you save battery so the fact that this watch does it all the time can be cool but also can nuke your battery all the time when I go to bedtime mode and just turn on like the sleep mode it doesn't say it's stopping those heart rate measurements it continues to measure my heart rate constantly I will say though the Saving Grace that makes it usable is that it does charge up very fast it does come with this plastic Puck charger in the box with a pretty weak magnet that feels like it could easily fall off also very first gen feeling but it could go from like 10 to 40 percent in like 15 minutes which is amazing and it can go from zero to a hundred in about an hour but okay all that being said the most clumsy thing about the pixel watch for sure is the fact that it's also a Fitbit or let me rephrase that Fitbit isn't built into the watch so much as it's like bolted on to the side so wear OS 3.5 here is it's fine it's pretty familiar it's still intuitive you've got your watch face with a swipe down to get to all your customizable Quick Settings that's nice and then you swipe up to get to your notifications your list of apps is one click of the crown away but your recent apps is behind that secondary button that I find I almost never use then you can swipe sideways between a predetermined set of tiles that you can organize in the phone app and these are like these big quick shortcuts to screens that you might use a lot ongoing background things will show up at the bottom so if you have a notification there's a little dot for your notification dot if there's a music playing it'll show a little animation for that and if you're in the middle of something like a workout and a new notification comes in it'll show the logo down there for that too so to control any of the normal watch faces and complications which I really like a lot of them you go through the Watch app makes perfect sense but then for the fitness stuff that's where Fitbit which Google acquired in 2019 comes into play so when you set up the watch you actually make a Fitbit account and it starts you off with 6 free of Fitbit premium which is a subscription service so as a smart watch I've mostly enjoyed using it's been fine like it's smooth it has a good performance but it does feel disjointed sometimes in ways where like you'd expect it to sync more things with the phone but it doesn't like for example when I put my pixel phone my pixel phone in Do Not Disturb mode the watch does not go to do not disturb mode it keeps buzzing it has its own separate Do Not Disturb mode basic stuff like it feels like it should work together more than just being a Bluetooth accessory connected to your phone but then you do a bunch of Fitness stuff a bunch of workouts or whatever sleep tracking and then the watch dumps all of that Fitness data into the Fitbit app now there is still a Google Fit app by the way the watch doesn't really talk to it at all so what does that mean for the future of the Google Fit app I don't know your phone can still talk to it and dump like step counting in there but then you're using two different apps to track Fitness so I I don't know and then even throughout the watch UI all the Fitbit stuff it's in there but it also it kind of just feels like they just dropped it in there on top like instead of ECG it's Fitbit ECG and a set of exercise it's Fitbit exercise and then you start using these features and the free six month trial before you realize a ton of the stuff it's collecting and that you're using like the breathing rate heart rate variation sleep stage tracking and sleep scores all of that goes behind a Fitbit 10 a month subscription paywall when the free trial is over it feels like you can see the Arc of the thinking where like Google wanted people to use a Google watch so they bought Fitbit and then as I integrated it they realized oh people love the Fitbit name and they still want a Fitbit so you can't remove that name or that branding so people now get the Google watch that has Fitbit in it and they use the Fitbit app but then there's also Google fit in the background that they hopefully also choose to use sometimes and they all don't really talk to each other now all this stuff you know it doesn't make the rest of the parts of the watch worst use it all still works it's just it adds to this first gen feeling here where you can tell that there is a lot that can get better and this is the funny thing about reviewing products that you're like hoping to be good you end up sounding really harsh like a disappointed parent or something basically I think this whole pixel watch thing has a lot of potential and I really do enjoy parts of it having Google assistant on my wrist everywhere is awesome downloading music to stream offline the turn-by-turn navigation with maps The Voice to Text to respond to Notifications all that is great but they clearly still have some first gen learnings to do like the the charger the heart rate monitoring that is constant that doesn't seem to have any adjusting ability uh the Fitbit integration even the connectivity problems I've had a little bit of connectivity issues with mine here and there but some of my friends who are also reviewing this watch right now have had a nightmare of a time just keeping it connected to their phone so I'll let them talk about that in their reviews so like I was hoping this would be some amazing watch straight from the start which I should know better right like first gen stuff is never amazing right from the go but you know it's starting from zero here like there's not a lot of bands there's not a lot of accessories for this it's 350 and for that money you could get a more mature version of a smart watch that has more features that has better battery life that has things that aren't behind a subscription paywall and that ultimately will probably be a better experience but for now it's fine for their first foray into forearm Fitness and fashion but functionally it's still far from finished oh hey look a notification from this video sponsor rocket money you might heard of them they're previously known as true bill that's when I signed up I had this service for years but this is an all-in-one Finance platform that helps you keep track of your finances and also helps you manage your money too but actually my favorite feature of Rocket money is that it helps you cancel unwanted subscriptions which can kind of just like pile up in the background so you connect your bank account it scans through all of your charges and then it puts all in one place all of your subscriptions and with like a single press of a button will let you cancel the stuff that you might have forgotten about even if there's like a free trial you signed up for a while ago you just cancel it and be done with it but also rocket money can help you lower your monthly bills for your phone internet or cable it says you literally take a picture of your bill and the app will negotiate the bills on your behalf it's kind of sick and you can also monitor your credit score right from the app it's great it's easy to save money using this thing so if you want to check it out it's free or you can unlock more features using the premium account just go to rocketmoney.com MKBHD it'll be a link right below the like button if you want to head over and check it out and I'll be over there too but until the next one thanks for watching see you later peace [Music],"Bruh that is the worst watch | Just bought one in February 2025 for 50 bucks refurbished ... works with the Fitbit app upgrading from a Fitbit Charge 2 ... using with a Pixel 8a and have the Pixel Buds Series A as well. Inside the Fitbit app you can change how often it reads your biometrics ... so there is that for 50 bucks I'm not complaining. Good video. | It looks like they implemented almost all of your feedback into the new gen. So I'm totally looking forward to your Pixel Watch 3 Review! | marques the type of guy to change watch bands every single night to sleep in a different band lmfao and say to his watch ""g'night, sweet dreams"" | Marques 
I never knew you had a tattoo 😮 | Deal-breaker- that it doesn't automatically turn off watch when you put phone on do not disturb!
Thx for the heads up! | Nice alliteration at the end | My old galaxy watch 2 can do more than that | I bought some Casio Proteks that are atomic sync'd and solar charged, maintenance free forever, grab them and go and the time is always right within plus minus 5 seconds.          My Huawei smart watch was useless, and now Android Wear is dead and nothing google on it works anymore... the play store, the apps, the mail, nothing.      The question is, what is the entire world suppose to do with their dead useless Android Wear watches.   If you create a product, you should support it forever, esp. if the world adopts it as an operating system. | I can't wait for new battery tech that lasts longer."
NE5H5intsck,Google Pixel 7/Pro Review: Hard Problems? Software Answers!,Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro are the smartest phones in the room. How far can that take them? Skin your Google Pixel 7 and 7 Pro at ...,2022-10-12T17:00:29Z,4983638,153382,6532,foreign [Music] pixel sevens seven and seven per I'm using these songs for about a week now and yes they are very similar to last year they're the same prices too but more than ever this year and you can see it at every corner the pixel special is software solutions to Hardware problems and this is in contrast to say the Samsung or the xiaomi special which is throw as much raw Hardware horsepower at the thing as possible there's just no way that isn't better than before and there's nothing right or wrong with either of these approaches matter of fact as a Tech head you can kind of appreciate both but there is there is just a little bit of a magic to this software way at least when it works so yeah I can definitely appreciate the slightly updated Hardware on the outside of the pixel because even though it isn't super important to the Google Mission it's still important to the users so initially with my very first Hands-On I didn't love it but it's kind of growing on me the main change here being the metal camera bar instead of the All Glass visor from last year it lets them do some interesting stuff with the colors but most importantly lets them make it all one piece of metal all the way around with the frame of the rest of the phone it's polished aluminum on the pro and matte aluminum on the pixel 7. then both phones also get brighter displays up to 1500 nits Peak on the 7 Pro and 1400 nits on the regular pixel 7. can't fake that with software and then the 7 Pro display is larger slightly curved over the edges and a generally better looking display with less off-axis rainbowing but interestingly it's set to 1080p out the box by default even though it's a 1440p panel I immediately switched that to 1440 and have had no battery issues so I recommend doing that matter of fact might as well just say it right off the top I have had great battery experiences with these phones I've been mostly dailying the 7 Pro David at the studio has been dailying the seven and yeah they've been excellent like just this morning today drove into the studio had an hour-long commute with Waze on full brightness GPS streaming Spotify audio through Bluetooth to the car got here with like 85 battery left and I'm consistently ending days with 30 to 40 percent six to seven hours is not a problem uh yeah I've had very good battery life on these phones very impressive that's a combination of software optimization better modems just better chip overall but speaking of chips inside the phone there are very few new specs but the new second generation tensor G2 from Google is one of them there's also a little bit extra RAM on the pro phone it does Benchmark a bit higher than the first tensor but in terms of raw power it's right in line with the Snapdragon 865 fine but just like I talked about in the problem with benchmarks video which you can watch here if you haven't seen it already Google is optimizing this tensor G2 chip to work more efficiently specifically with its AI stuff it's AI magic so while yeah the G2 is a little faster than the first tensor with its smaller four nanometer process node the real improvements are in its machine learning capabilities which are 60 faster and 20 percent more efficient than last year so the things that actually require those AI smarts are dramatically better and faster so that is where it starts to get interesting not to dismiss the you know slight improvements of the pixel overall I mean you can see they even they painted inside the port and the speakers down here to match the rails of the phone it's nice I like it but that's not what the pixel is all about the pixel is the software it is the smartest smartphone and pretty much all the reasons you'd pick a phone like a pixel 7 over the rest are in the software like for phone calls for example pixel is the only phone with call screening which to me is still super useful but it also goes to another level so when you call a business that has an automated system the improved direct my call feature will surface all the buttons at once so you can press to navigate through an automated system before the robot even finishes saying them it saves me so much time I love that I also like the new home screen search which still has all the great functionality as before it's just cleaner and better designed and then with the new selfie camera the pixel has added AI based Face Unlock which is great but as you can see it's just a single selfie camera up top here there's no infrared depth mapping or face ID equivalent so while it's super fast in great conditions it absolutely struggles as expected when you're in the dark or when you have a mask on so there's also still an under display fingerprint reader for dual biometric authentication anytime Face Unlock fails I will say I was hoping that the fingerprint reader would be one of the things that improved to the pixel 7 Hardware wise because the one in the six was a little bit of a letdown for me it's it's not noticeably bigger or faster it's fine it's not terrible it's just a slight step behind the ultrasonic ones which are noticeably faster than this Optical one oh also the recorder app most some people don't even care about this but the recorder app is better it's already the best in the world at doing incredibly fast and accurate speech to text you've seen this before thanks tensor but I got an amazing demo of somebody starting a recording and then putting the phone in their pocket and we had a full-on conversation they took the phone out of their pocket and it had perfectly transcribed our entire conversation with speaker labels so each time the opposite person spoke it labeled that incredibly useful or incredibly creepy depending on who you are but that's one of the features that's allegedly coming later this year to an update I'm going to be using that and it just definitely feels like anywhere you go on this phone Google assistant is waiting right around the corner waiting to help you out it was the same with the last pixel Android 13 got its improvements with material U and the under the hood improvements but just the Google stuff everywhere the routines the little reminders the little chip cards words and messages for helpful things you might want to do to add to a message there's a lot of good stuff there's even a new feature called photo unblur you might have seen the demos basically takes any photo in your pixel 7's Library actually anything in your Google photos library at all and if it's a little bit blurry you hit that unblur button and it can use AI to identify what the scene should look like and fix the photo remove the blur seems super cool so okay after trying this with a bunch of photos we found that it seems to work best specifically with photos of subjects that are in Focus but the exposure time was too long and so now there's a bit of blur in One Direction in that exact instance I found it can do a pretty good job of turning a streaky blurry photo into something much more usable I wouldn't expect anything magical but you know this is pretty cool it's the definition of using software to solve Hardware problems also if they do say pixel 7 exclusive for this feature for now I don't really buy it they say it's because of temps or G2 I give it about a year before this feature is available for more phones maybe anyone using Google photos but hey for now gotta have a pixel 7. but the point is Google is not setting out to make a phone with the absolute best hardware and the best display and the absolute best raw performance I mean if they are they're failing but Google pixel is absolutely the smartest smartphone in the room it's the smartest phone you can get and it's even more true again this year now the pixel has been known for one other thing probably as long as anything else and that's the cameras and there's an updated Suite of cameras on the front and the back of the pixel 7s this year so the 50 megapixel primary camera is the same on both same as last year the pro gets a new even wider Ultra wide with autofocus while the 7 keeps the one from last year and the pro also gets a new 5x 48 megapixel telephoto camera and as expected the pixel 7 and 7 Pro take X excellent photos in a variety of different lighting conditions and they have that very distinct pixel style the high dynamic range contrasty lots of detail those shots this big sensor can create some pretty nice natural depth of field still without using portrait mode I love that I know I shouldn't be super impressed that you know normal daylight photos look great on the pixel but hey these are really really good and then the new Pro Ultra wide does a really good job with macro photography doesn't do macro video but this photo of an ant is really hard to get and the auto switching to macro mode can be disabled if you're like me and prefer taking close-up photos of things with the main camera just be aware of minimum Focus distance but then here's another great example of solving Hardware problems with software the zoom so the One X camera still normal 1X that's a 50 megapixel main sensor binning down to 12 megapixels the 2x button is a 12 megapixel crop of the middle of the frame so a high quality Zoom then from 2x to 5 5x the camera is actually doing some composition it's adding detail in the middle of the frame from the telephoto camera and then compositing them together then you get to 5x and it's snapping to the full telephoto camera that makes perfect sense then again the 10x is taking a 12 megapixel crop of the middle of the telephoto so another high quality zoom and it's pretty good I will say it's not quite as good as having a dedicated 10x telephoto camera on the back of the phone like having a dedicated camera is always going to give you the sharper overall image but for someone like me who only zooms once in a while the whole super resume software solution is very passable as you can see and then that saves you money and then you get the zoom stabilization that activates at 15x and it is really really stable maybe a little too stable sometimes because it kind of makes it hard to track like moving objects which I know you love to do when you're creeping I mean bird watching anyway yeah the pixels camera right still top of the Heap when it comes to point and shoot Android cameras the shutter speed is super fast so if you're trying to freeze motion and also capture like an exact moment this camera is really good at that the selfie cameras on both are also improved it's now an 11 megapixel selfie camera they both do ultra wide selfies now instead of just the pro love that and video is slightly better too including 10-bit HDR tough to show that in this SDR video but if you've seen HDR video before you know where this excels already anything with bright specular highlights loads of dynamic range Etc it's still a step behind the iPhone when it comes to noise levels and autofocus so for those curious why I still put the iPhone as the overall king of smartphone imagery that's why but this is not far behind by any means okay here's a couple other small things that didn't fit into the rest of this review the speakers on the 7 Pro are slightly louder but slightly less Bassy than the 6 Pro just a little tinier so a little less low end for a little bit more vocal Clarity I found that interesting and then there's not a whole lot going for sustainability for these phones other than the metal visor and frame being made with 100 recycled materials some pretty specific wording there but also the box that comes in which doesn't have a charger does come with a cable and an adapter and is fully recyclable cardboard and then a big question are there bugs because my pixel 6 experience was a roller coaster I mean I I love the phone to start but then it's slowly descended into having more and more bugs until I it was like unusable to me and I stopped using it then it got some updates that squashed those bugs and then I ended up dailying it for like the last two months or so so all their bugs on the pixel 7s yeah I have found some I mean I had this media player bug where it just shows a blank space where the media player is supposed to be whether or not there was any media playing that did go away after reboot there was also this weird thing where after you hit the X in the Google search bar that button just disappears but it's still pressable for some reason also I tried to post the Instagram story from the pixel 7 Pro the other day and it just looked like this for some reason honestly no idea what happened here everyone saw it apparently some people thought it was an ad for dbrand's new digital camo it wasn't but this is hey if your new metal bar isn't enough and you want your new pixel to look even more different from the rest Channel sponsor dbrand's new skin is pretty sick and it's a foolproof way to make your phone look unique plus it hopes to hide that dust that sort of naturally accumulates right above and below the camera bar so link below of course right below that like button but I've really enjoyed using the pixel and that's why it's going in my pocket as my daily driver phone for now anyway as far as whether you should get one or not I think the real question is how much money are you willing to spend because same prices as last year 5.99 8.99 and I think my initial feeling is I still feel the same which some people got kind of Twisted by the way but the 300 difference between these phones the pixel 7 is a way better deal than the 7 Pro like they're both well priced and they're both very competitive and frankly undercutting most of what they're competing against but the seven is just for most people a no-brainer so uh this is the phone I'm gonna be recommending more often probably a value phone of the Year Contender again look there's a lot of stuff Google didn't do with the pixels like they didn't do super fast 80 watt charging they didn't do multiple telephoto cameras it doesn't even fold in half right there's a lot of stuff but for patient Pixel People Who prefer pristine programming and pretty pictures the pixel Pro is pretty perfect [Music],"Had this phone since its launch. Very mixed bag. 

Positives:  The OS ran smoothly, the battery held up well, and the standard camera was good for basic day/night shooting. 

Negatives: The fingerprint reader was trash being much worse than old-school readers found on the back of phones, the display brightness was very poor, the primary mic was buggy, the audio DAC was subpar when playing music via earbuds, and the camera system outside of standard shots was poor (the 2x zoom was just a cropped standard image).

Usually keep my phones for more than 2 years, but I'm done with the Pixel 7. Seemed like good value at the time, but Google cut corners all over the place. I'm switching to the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, which is a huge upgrade hardware-wise. Granted that's a more expensive phone, but you get what you pay for. | Daily drove the Pixel 7 for 2 years. Worst fucking android distro I've ever experienced. I couldn't even put apps into folders in the app drawer. So I had to buy a different launcher. The AI stuff is a gimmick, and I never used them. The keyboard led to either constant typos or bad autocorrects.
Now I'm back on Samsung with OneUI and life's a dream again. | Screen gone to green and even not possible to see something. I couldn't use even one year. Shame on you Google such a shit phone. I need screen replacement, asking 400 euro for replacement. | hermoso video, Gracias Marques! | Just got the 512gb 7 Pro for a price very similar to the 7 they had just because I needed a better phone with Qi charging and good battery. These other features are exciting to see glad I picked that one I don't need the latest ones I don't think they even have storage that big on the newer ones. | Perfect review my bro..I wish I could give me one of pixel devices.. saidu bangura from sierra Leone | I've had my Pixel 7 since January and it's been great. Planning on keeping this until it's had its last update at least, and then probably getting another Pixel. | Which one to buy 7 pro or 8 pls tell me 😭😭😭😭 | are there other pixel 7 users here who'd like to give their own comments on the battery life? | Pixel 7 pro is best looking pixel of all time!!! Yeah even over the 9 pro, it's just so good."
CgJCxnRap00,The Apple Watch Stand Hours Glitch...,I wanted to see if you could get more than 24 stand hours in 1 day. There was only 1 way to find out...,2022-10-10T23:25:19Z,11407230,673890,2187,all right one of the great Mysteries of the Apple watch have you guys ever wondered the question is can you get 24 stand hours actually can you get more than 24 sand hours so a stand hour is pretty simple right you just stand up for 60 seconds out of every hour and your Apple watch can detect that you're standing and give you credit for that stand hour so 24 stand hours is already going to be really hard theoretically if you fly backwards a few time zones and stand up for every single hour then you will add up to over 24 stand hours in a day so that's exactly what I did so I just got on a flight to California which is three hours behind East Coast time and I made sure I was getting those stand hours in yes I did miss one but I stood up every single other hour starting at midnight and every hour on the plane which was really annoying but I did it for the cause 22 23 24 and then Moment of Truth this is what 25 stand hours looks like confirmed it works I'm so tired,"Smh get it | Markass literally went to the nathroom in an airplane every hour to get that standing time | How did u ride on a Boeing 747???? | You know if you shake your arm while laying down for 60 secs it detects as standing👀🤣 | Or just become a workaholic like me | Soo cool | Flew from Australia to Hawaii today, didn’t stand for the 10 hour flight, have been asleep for about 5 hours, and so far have 22 hours of stand time. | So basically changed the timezone and got extra 3 hours | Yes you can. I got 28/hrs!! Flew “back” six timezones.. | Just put the watch on a mannequin 😂"
CMtF7nxMv5A,Pixel 7/Pro and Watch Impressions!,Google Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro are now real. But also so is the Pixel Watch. That shirt! http://shop.MKBHD.com On iPhone 14 Plus ...,2022-10-07T03:04:20Z,4746924,165714,6267,pixel has always been a leader in smartphone Innovation and we take it as a compliment when others in the industry follow our lead like the always-on display and at a glance introduced with pixel 2 and there's night sight which launched with pixel 3 and astrophotography and we introduced car crash detection three years ago pixel 7 pixel 7's Pro's front camera uses our Advanced machine learning models for face recognition to power face unlocked iPhone 10 your iPhone is locked until you look at it and it recognizes you we call this face ID we're introducing cinematic blur to the pixel camera in iPhone 13 brings a brand new feature cinematic mode starting at 2X super resume crops pixel 7 Pro's main 50 megapixel camera using a high resolution mode to provide a 12.5 megapixel 12 megapixels of the new sensor to deliver a full resolution photo and 4K video with Optical quality yeah I kind of just love how tech companies just throw subtle shots at each other on stage even though we all know at this point they're just copying each other in a giant Circle till we have the same features across everything anyway today was Google's event and we got our first look at Impressions and our Hands-On time with the Google pixel 7 and pixel 7 Pro and the pixel watch which is really interesting and we also got a preview of a really interesting look at the new pixel tablet so this video is everything you need to know about all that stuff so the phones there's a big phone and a small phone again the pixel 7 and the pixel 7 Pro they very much look like the pixel 6 now that it's an established recognizable visor identity but this time the visor is metal instead of glass and I don't love it but I also don't hate it like I guess I was one of the few people that really got to liking the glass visor but I will say this time it is one continuous piece of metal all the way around with no seam and that is better than before and it just feels really well built but you can also see the pixel 7 visor is matte while the pixel 7 Pro visor is glossy which I can already tell I'm gonna get this 7 Pro covered in fingerprints also I'm just going to say I miss accented color power buttons just throwing that out there anyway no other real design surprises here but then on the inside there is an updated set of specs so there they are you can pause this if you need to but basically the bigger phone has a telephoto lens more RAM and a bigger battery and a bigger higher res ltpo display that's the deal but here's something I noticed I wasn't really mentioned even out loud during the keynote which is the pixel 7 display is flat again and you can see the cut out at the top for the new Ultra wide 11 megapixel selfie camera that they both share it's pretty sweet but the pixel 7 Pro display curves over the edges a bit less than before it's just a subtle curve now I'm really happy to see that but then as I mentioned in the last video which was about the iPhone 14 plus and benchmarks and how the big General Benchmark improvements are probably going to be pretty slight I was more interested just to see features just new interesting features that they enable on these new phones right and we got some and they range from kind of cool seen that already all the way to possibly incredible so yeah I'm going to keep my eye out on the overall performance of this next Generation tensor G2 chip efficiency smoothness all that but it also enables a few things a new cinematic video mode which basically appears to be doing the same thing Apple's new cinematic mode does which is track subjects and artificially blur backgrounds it also enables transcribed audio messages right in the Google messages app so if someone sends you a voice memo you don't have to find a place to listen to it you can just read it in text form and it makes night sight twice as fast it enables Face Unlock from just the new selfie camera and it should be able to do all this with 20 lower power consumption than the first tensor chip but the coolest feature to me easily is unblur is what it's called so so you have a picture that's slightly blurry you know maybe your hands were kind of shaky or it was slightly out of focus or you just had a slow shutter speed or something happened it's blurry it's soft normally you throw photo out but you don't have any other pictures of that moment and it was just too perfect and you kind of just want to save it or fix it so you can open that picture on the pixel 7 or 7 Pro and you hit that button and the tensor chip goes to work and it basically fixes the picture it uses AI it recognizes subjects and sharpens things up and it does a really good job you can see a before and after here of some of the pre-loaded photos I was trying at the event and they are genuinely impressive and the cherry on top is so you have to have a pixel 7 or 7 Pro to do this for now but you can do this with any picture in your entire Google photos Library any photo you've ever taken or even any photo you just save or have on your phone anything I can see people like remastering old Polaroids or like 30 year old yearbook photos just whatever else is in your library that you want to save seems pretty cool I'm going to be testing it for the full review to see how well it actually works with non-presupplied photos but I was impressed but then really mostly other changes that were interesting about these phones came in a camera department on the pro phone so there's a new ultrawide with autofocus just on the pro phone that is 21 wider and should be able to take some pretty decent macro photos now with these Focus pixels and there's a new 5x telephoto camera that's also huge 48 megapixels again and then they've worked a lot of software magic with making the in-between marks much more usable so for example the 2x button here will crop into the middle 12 megapixels of the main camera for a nice clean Zoom sound familiar but then the 10x does the same thing so the 10x Zoom is really just cropping into the middle 12 megapixels of the 5x telephoto camera so again hopefully a nice clean zoom and then a lot of super resume software magic and hopefully sharpening the photos of in between those numbers but there's also haptic stops in the camera UI to make it easy to hopefully hit those nice Clean Magic numbers and they also added a zoom preview thing for the furthest extremes of Zoom like Samsung did so now when you're taking those super creeper shots at like 30X it'll be nice and stable and easy to frame my biggest question is did they price these correctly because they went with the same prices as last year which is 5.99 for the small phone and 8.99 for the big one which okay it's the same I have a feeling 300 is going to feel like a big gap again like this is what we were saying last year for 300 extra dollars over the small phone you're getting bigger screen nicer battery and a telephoto camera and that's kind of it this year it feels like a tiny bit more it's screen battery and then like a whole Pro camera system with a better ultrawide and a better telephoto with lots of Zoom stuff but is that enough 300 I I don't know we'll see I just have a feeling that the the seven will feel like a good deal and then a 7 Pro will feel like a tougher sell again but then we also finally got to see the Google pixel watch this is the thing that's been kind of hyped a lot I got to spend a little less time with it but I'm very interested in reviewing this particular watch so this might be a hot take but I think they did a b-plus job on the design I think it's really nice uh the full circle is great it's just one size which is pretty small and very lightweight there's three colors black silver and gold and definitely doesn't look like a computer on your wrist like some others can it can be a super inconspicuous little puck of a smart watch there's just two buttons the crown which can also scroll and then a button right above it and the way the watch bands connect to the watch is pretty neat it's a little bit finicky to me at first but I suspect it just takes some getting used to and the result is just this super seamless look with no lugs where it looks like the band just kind of pops out the top and the bottom of this circle now here's why I say B plus and not a plus bezels and battery so they curve the glass right over all the edges and kept the UI mostly black which is really thoughtful because most of the time especially in lower lighting it looks like it's basically a seamless display on your wrist most of the backgrounds are black most of the UI elements look like they're designed around sort of fading in and not overlapping the edges too much and even when they do overlap they have this nice little gradient even the flashlight app has a fade all the way around so you don't really think too hard about the bezel it's smart but if you catch the Light just right or maybe you're outside a lot then yeah you can see the bezel which is clearly not the smallest thing in the world okay fine but I'm actually a little bit more worried about battery life so they set on stage up to 24 hours of battery which you know knowing these companies is probably generous like that's probably maybe best case scenario without the always-on display maybe one workout and I mean this watch is truly tiny it's very Compact and light like there's just no way you can have a huge battery in it but I think it's a good idea to subscribe to be among the first to see the full review when it goes live and I get a chance to really test it functionality wise though it is very much a Fitbit Smart Watch like I think it might be more of a Fitbit than a lot of people were expecting but you know smart watch wise it does all the normal stuff notifications custom watch faces Google pay with wallet Google Maps directions Google Assistant to set timers play some music Etc it's wear OS but then it's Fitbit for all the fitness stuff which there's plenty of so if you've used a Fitbit you already know about the workouts and mindfulness content and health metrics and sleep tracking and a sleep score and it has some really high frequency heart rate monitoring one reading every single second but other than the specifically the heart rate monitoring stuff it uses the Fitbit app for all that stuff so not Google Fit what happens to Google Fit unclear actually but the watch comes with six months of Fitbit premium for free and that you just interact with all this data just like it's a Fitbit so yeah it's a it's a Fitbit smart watch or it's a smart watch with Fitbit on top for all the fitness stuff so it's 349 for the Wi-Fi only and 400 for cellular so that means it's more expensive than the Apple watch SE it's more expensive than the Samsung Galaxy watch 5. interesting let me know which one of those smart watches you would consider for that money but lastly we did get a preview of the tablet another one but this time it did it was basically just one one really cool feature which is that it docks to a magnetic speaker dock and becomes basically a nest Hub Max and I think this is brilliant most tablets are just like around the house most of the time and Google knows this so they just built the ultimate house tablet I guess I do think though that this is a bit of a clue that this isn't going to be a super high-end like iPad Pro Galaxy Tab Pro super crazy premium like tablet this is this is definitely not competing with those like this thing will have a 10 inch screen single camera white bezels it's like this thing's designed for the 80 of tablets that just sit around the house and don't do too much like not the top few percent that are doing Peak Performance and productivity and media stuff I'm guessing and this is pure speculation and you can quote this I'm going to guess that this will be a 4.99 tablet like that's how I see this and then you'll buy the doc extra but we'll come back to this clip and see if I was right but yeah stay tuned for the reviews happy techtober thanks for watching this one and I'll catch you guys later peace [Music],"I feel like sometime in between 2026 to 2030, we are going to have ""big phones"" that are the

HjEqOWjTkHE,Apple Watch Ultra Review: Worth It Or Nah?,"The Apple Watch Ultra is $800, which makes it worth it only for a certain set of people... Grab an MKBHD x Moment Apple Watch ...",2022-09-21T13:00:40Z,8207120,193843,8597,so on saturday morning i woke up with the apple watch ultra charged up to 100 battery drove to practice i had ultimate frisbee practice out in new york a lot of people don't realize how many calories you burned during a three-hour practice but there you go finished that drove home and then went about the rest of my day i ended that day going to sleep with about 69 battery nice then slept with the watch on for sleep tracking then woke up on sunday morning with 60 drove into new york city again had another practice this one a little hotter sun's baking a little more three more hours and 2 000 calories later that was over drove home went about the rest of my day again and then again i slept with the watch on for sleep tracking woke up on monday morning drove to the studio now it's monday morning 11am at the studio and i currently have 20 battery lift it's pretty good that's two days and two nights and into the third day which is far better than i've ever been able to get out of any other apple watch period but let's rewind for a second [Music] so we knew something like this was coming we knew there was going to be an upgraded ruggedized apple watch in some way and i think a lot of people sort of assumed it would be called the apple watch pro but instead we got this thing and it's called the apple watch ultra the thing is though it would have actually been totally reasonable and probably kind of perfect if they'd also call this the watch pro and that's just because of the way apple treats the word pro nowadays like apples toss the name pro around the highest end versions of almost all of their products iphone pro macbook pro airpods pro ipad pro pro display and each of these expensive devices has some set of features that a smaller fraction of the population can actually take advantage of and use now whether that makes you a pro or a hardcore user or an enthusiast or a wannabe pro like what is a pro airpods user anyway that's a debate for another day but it's the same thing with this apple watch ultra i've been using it for about a week now and the way i think about it is there's a core group of people for which the apple watch se actually covers all their needs and that's like most of the population but then there's an additional group a little bigger than that for which the standard apple watch which is now series 8 covers all of their possible uses so you know it adds the always-on display the different sizes etc it's already a really versatile smartwatch but there's still some people around the outskirts for whom the regular apple watch still wasn't enough and apple naturally still wants those people so this is an 800 watch that has some extra premium features and specs that are amazing and definitely overkill for most people like the ones in the middle of my illustration but it's attractive for the most extreme users the adventurers who go on serious hikes or go diving or run marathons or do triathlons so there's really three main things that they added to this watch over the regular one which are ruggedness features and battery and they all kind of go hand in hand for ruggedness well it's pretty obvious they just beefed this thing up so it's now much bigger 49 millimeters diagonally but it has the shapes and materials now of a watch that should be much harder to break it's a titanium case with a ceramic back it has much bigger buttons that don't have quite as much travel as i expected but they are easier to press with gloves there's the bigger crown and then the crown guard on the side here it's a very distinct look and then the display at the top here is a flat sapphire crystal instead of the normal curving over the edges with this slightly raised lip all the way around the screen so it's protected from corner impacts to me it's pretty huge like this is a pretty massive watch i will say it is not nearly as heavy as it looks which is pretty nice uh but it does visually stand out for a couple of reasons one this is the only color so this is the exposed titanium it looks very silver i wish it came in black because black is slimming like you can make a black watch look smaller with a black band but that would admittedly require black paint which would probably get like scratched and then the silver would show through and then it would look pretty gnarly after a while so i get it maybe they could anodize it i don't know but yeah big silver watch on skinny wrist looks big but then also two this shape see like this is a big watch to me someone who wears pretty much only smart watches right and smart watches are kind of weird shapes sometimes like it's a computer on the wrist type of a look it's sort of just a block but in the overall watch world the apple watch ultra is actually nowhere near the biggest watch you'll see like some people are very used to much larger watches on their wrists actually and especially those people on the outskirts i was talking about earlier they're fairly used to wearing some of these massive garmins or suuntos or even specialized activity specific equipment like dive computers that'll make the apple watch ultra look compact so the whole like this watch is huge thing is very much up to context but the thing is like a lot of these watches here are bigger than the apple watch but they are watch shaped they're circular up front and then they have this taper around the wrist at the top and the bottom so they don't look like they stick out nearly as much even though they do where the apple watch just doesn't taper at all it's just like a block so yeah the computer on the wrist thing i don't know i actually don't mind the aesthetic like i said i just wish it came in black that would have been nice i wonder if colorware is going to be able to paint these things anyway that's the build quality but the other two things that make the ultra ultra are battery and capability battery being pretty simple it's a much bigger watch and it has room for more battery inside but we'll get to that in a second but the capabilities just come in the form of extra features so the extra microphone and extra speakers for better audio quality in windy environments the dual frequency gps for more accurate and reliable gps and tougher settings like forests or in cities between skyscrapers the wr-100 water resistance rating for submersion up to a hundred meters the new 2000 nits max brightness for this display which means it's the most visible outdoors that i've seen a smartwatch oled plus it makes for a nice flashlight if you need it and most importantly the new extra button so that bright international orange colored button is called the action button and it can be mapped to right now any one of these eight things so i currently have mine to just open the new workout selector i pick the type of workout and then hit the action button again to get it started and then once you're in an activity there's again a layer of customization to what this action button can do so maybe marking segments or laps inside a track workout or marking when you switch from the bike to the run in a triathlon all kinds of stuff like that i really like having it i did feel like i accidentally pressed it a lot just because of the way i grabbed the watch and adjust the crown but i pretty quickly got used to that too i think the most noticeable thing that this apple watch has over other apple watches is gonna be the battery life so this like i said from the beginning two full days and two full nights with plenty of room to spare that's easily better than it's roughly double what i was able to get out of my apple watch series 7. the thing is while it is a massive improvement for an apple watch it's still nowhere near the other highest end watches which many of them are expected to go weeks months even years without even thinking about charging this one right here this casio watch it's a casio right casio pro trek uh which has solar charging has never been charged it is virtually infinite battery life it didn't even come with a charger in this watch world a two-day battery life is not that impressive but really that that brings me to the ultimate question with this ultra which is how are you going to be using this watch like if you're one of these people on the outside here that doesn't use an apple watch apple was trying to find a reason you didn't use it and add the features or capabilities to make you actually want to use it now because of course they want to bring you into the ecosystem so some of these people over here like these are frequent scuba divers and they've been using dedicated dive computers ranging from giant watch to tablet on the wrist to track depth and directions and a bunch of other safety metrics underwater now the apple watch ultra has added that wr-100 water resistance up to 100 meters there's a new dive app to track some pretty basic stuff like depth and give you times for safety stops on your way back up for recreational diving things like that but then apple also partnered with a third-party company for this oceanic plus app that's coming later this year that seems to do basically everything that the pro dive computers do including air integration pretty much the only thing it doesn't do that some extreme technical divers might want is tank pressure monitoring and depth monitoring past 40 meters now some of these people way over here these people are really adventurous hikers like not the normal beaten path casuals finding popular hikes on google i mean these people are going off and carving their own path for miles and miles in the middle of nowhere sometimes for days at a time so the watch ultra has got now a bunch of navigation related features there's dual frequency gps for more accurate pinpointed gps even in challenging locations but then the new compass app is pretty impressive it lets you set unlimited waypoints so that you can navigate back to them at any time and you can track your exact walking path with a backtrack feature in case visibility is difficult or you need the watch to guide you back where you came from there's also a super loud 86 decibel siren that can play from the new speaker system if you find yourself completely lost with no one around and yes it is actually impressively loud and you can hear it from probably a quarter mile away and there's a new wayfinder watch face by default that sort of puts all the stuff right at your fingertips including a live compass that's super smooth i think a lot of people just leave this face on all the time even if they don't need it but then some of the other people up over here are ultra endurance athletes and of course the name sort of speaks for itself here honestly the apple watch just didn't last long enough for these people's iron man races and ultra marathons and spartan races so the new watch ultras got the dual frequency gps which is huge and the action button is nice too but the significantly improved battery life is huge for these now it's not going to last a week or a year like some of the stop watches or simpler ones do but now it's just about double the battery life of the standard apple watch and it's finally up to the task of some of the most extreme gps heavy endurance athletes and even if it isn't apple has mentioned that there's this battery optimization setting feature coming later this year that it's not the low power mode that's already existed in the watch but it's an extra setting within workouts to ping gps and heart rate less often so in a normal workout for me which is it's a disc sports workout for an ultimate practice basically it's just it's measuring heart rate constantly like every few seconds which is super helpful you can see how quickly you recover you can see when you're in certain heart rate zones during the course of a practice but if you're running like a hundred miles or something ridiculous you don't need multiple pings every minute you just need a broader sense of how it's going so that's a helpful feature for these people and when you turn that on it should essentially triple the life of the apple watch apple says up to 60 hours i don't have it yet because it doesn't exist so i can't tell you exactly how well it does but that's a useful feature they even have a trio of new 99 bands for this watch for these activities so there's a trail band which looks kind of sick then the alpine loop and the ocean band as a reviewer i want to like i want to test all these activities and like go okay i guess i gotta run an ultra marathon now and like scuba dive but i can't remember the last time i was 10 meters underwater let alone 40. so i can't test all of this stuff but actually reached out and heard directly from these people on my podcast the waveform podcast i'll link the episode specifically below the like button so you can listen to it but i had on a diver an ultra runner and an alpinist so we asked them about the risk computers they currently use and whether or not they think this apple watch ultra is good enough to replace them and through those conversations one by one they each came to the end with basically the same conclusion which is that yeah it looks like they kind of did everything that they were looking for out of an apple watch i'll link it below so you can hear exactly what they said and then there's me so you know i'm a tech reviewer and an ultimate frisbee player so turns out the normal apple watch is actually enough for me like i said a normal ultimate workout or any sort of training we do is typically just a ton of heart rate readings there's not a bunch of gps pings or elevation tracking or anything like that so it's not super demanding but still on the ultra i'd get to reap the benefits of the battery only running down 20 during a practice instead of 40 and then the more accurate gps readings and the brighter screen are kind of nice to have on other activities maybe the occasional bike ride or a hike or stuff like that and it might be better for you too it's one of those things where i think generally if you have to ask you probably don't need it but it really reminds me of the rog phone like that thing is complete complete overkill for almost every human on the planet with all its crazy gaming features and absurdly high-end specs but also all those features for gaming also happen to make it better for media and regular use and it's basically the same thing here like this is technically speaking the best apple watch they've ever made it's got the longest battery life the biggest brightest display the best microphones and speakers and it's all in this most accurate tracking package yet i mean if your wrists are big enough then yeah you can daily this too it's kind of put itself in this unique category where it's replacing some of these extreme like dive computers or gps watches that you'd normally take off when you're done with your workout uh but it's an apple watch through and through at the end of the day you can wear this thing every single day i just don't know if you can like dress this thing down as much as you could a regular apple watch like fun fact i wore the apple watch series seven in midnight with my tux at the met gala and it didn't look insane to me anyway uh get a nice you know watch band with it like the leather one at shopdownitemphd.com it all works out great but yeah this one just because it's so it just sticks out it's massive all the time you can't really hide it as much might have a little more trouble with that but hey if you know what you're getting into the rog phone is a pretty good phone and if you know what you're getting into the apple watch ultra is a pretty good apple watch so that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace,"I want iPhone company to know I am buying this watch because of your through review | Wait they have a gaming smart 😮phone where have I been | lol frisbee practice  😂 | 50 dollar wall papers with naisal voice | Garmin Fenix 7 Pro Saphire Solar is much better in all aspects! | I love your videos amazing work, quick question do you know if it links to garmin the app so lets say i do a run will it upload to the garmin app. | What can you do with the solar powered Casio?…. Is it comparable to the ultra 2? | 4:22 
“Maybe they could anodize it” he said that two years before the black version of the Apple Watch Ultra came out this year… and guess what they did to turn it black? They anodized. Was this an Easter egg bruh?!😂😂 | 4:18 here is a one year later😂 | 2 years later and we finally got the black ultra. Also the flat screen is hard to overstate visually and functionally, it just feels and looks so much better. We need a new evolution of the ultra, not just a new color. smaller body, new shape/design, something."
v94jRN2FhGo,iPhone 14 Review: Repackaging 101!,There's something you should know about the iPhone 14 Check out the Nano 3 charger at https://ankerfast.club/Nano3MKBHD ...,2022-09-16T23:32:53Z,6196947,163064,9200,[Music] hey what's up mkhd here okay i've already reviewed the iphone 14 pro and 14 pro max you can watch those at the link below the like button the dynamic island the camera upgrade all that the bottom line is that is a far more interesting set of phones that has a few things that are actually new to the iphone which is kind of cool the iphone 14 on the other hand uh not so much not so much this is almost the exact same phone as last year so do you remember those s updates we used to get like we'd have the iphone 5 and then the iphone 5s and then s for speed because it was the same phone but just faster this phone is even less of an update than those s upgrades used to be and so that's what i want to talk about in this review is this new repackaging strategy thing that apple's been doing especially more lately with a bunch of their products so this year we do get an iphone 14 and an iphone 14 plus this 14 is out now and the 14 plus is coming out in a month in october it's basically the same thing just bigger 6.1 inches here 6.7 inches there and so many things are the same as last year's phone on the outside the design is the same the iphone 13 cases literally work with the iphone 14. like this is the new ali abdowl dbrand grip case on the iphone 14 it's pretty sweet but then again here is my iphone 13 from last year and yep fits perfectly but yeah same squared off sides same button placement same camera arrangement same antennas same speakers etc and then on the inside it's literally the same chip from last year it's the a15 bionic again technically a slight bump up with the extra gpu cores that was in the 13 pro but i mean yeah last year's chip too now technically you could say these are all things that i liked about the iphone 13 so hey if it ain't broke don't fix it right that's apple but that also means that a lot of things that could have stood to improve that could have gotten better also didn't change so it's the same display with the same brightness and the same 60hz refresh rate in an 800 phone i mean it would be so unlike apple but i really would have loved to have seen like 90 hertz here but yeah same storage options same battery size same charging speeds same lightning port the way i see it it's an iphone 13 again a year later with some tiny improvements matter of fact here is a full comprehensive list of every single thing that's technically new okay crash detection satellite connectivity display resolution e-sim new colors better thermal design better repairability design new primary camera and new selfie camera well this should be easy so crash detection is cool it uses some new sensors inside the phone and combines a bunch of data from the gps and microphones etc to notice if you've been in a car crash and if you have it'll notify emergency services without you having to do anything it's cool it's a nice feature i hope i never have to use it and then if you're in the middle of nowhere with no cell service and you still need help the iphone 14 series can now communicate with satellites in case of emergency to help you get your location and your needs to someone at a dispatch center that's coming to the us and canada in november that's another nice feature that i hope i never have to use the display is technically a slightly higher resolution with slightly thinner bezels but you will definitely never notice that and the new lineup in the us is now also e-sim only to be fair the setup process and transferring service from my previous iphone's physical sim was actually super easy it's like maybe two minutes tops and most other phones coming out today new also support esim so i'm hoping the transfer process in the future is also smooth but yeah no physical sim card tray here in the states there also is this new blue color then again most of you like an extremely high percentage of you have said that you use a case on your phone so i wonder how many of those are clear cases and then apple did mention an improved thermal design inside this phone for the same a15 bionic chip which can help performance at the edges of normal use cases so like playing a game for a really long time or navigating with high screen brightness with the phone in your dashboard in your car on a hot sunny day things that might get extra warm have an added layer of protection against throttling i think that's something the pro users will care more about but i definitely won't complain that it's also here and the better repairability design was mentioned also near the end of the keynote it's a little thing but it's actually pretty surprising from apple which is that the glass back is now a separate piece from the rest of the internals making it easier to replace cool but easily the biggest physical change with these new iphones is going to be the cameras so there's a slightly new 12 megapixel primary camera the ultrawide is exactly the same hardware and a new 12 megapixel selfie camera with autofocus now i spent a bunch of time looking back and forth at pictures i took on the iphone 14 and the iphone 13 trying to pinpoint the improvements it's like a game of spot the differences and there are some differences but they are so slight so this new camera is still 12 megapixels but it is a larger sensor so the individual pixels are bigger and should let in more light and then the max aperture went from f 1.6 to f 1.5 in regular daytime lighting there is pretty much no difference like the iphone is perfectly capable of crisp detailed natural looking photos when there are no challenges just like every other 800 phone always has been really the only difference i'm seeing is maybe color temperature the iphone 14 can take some occasionally cooler photos and it's noticeable if you have the right colors in the picture but here's a shot from the iphone 14 pro with the 48 megapixel pro raw shot for context here you can actually see a bit of a difference it's a slightly different focal length but also more importantly there's lots more fine detail here and just for fun here's the pixel 6 pro same shot another great detailed photo but just looks like a different style but as expected most of the differences between these that i found were more on the edge cases of normal photography that more challenging or extreme lighting situations mostly in low light and so some of this is enabled by the slightly larger sensor and faster aperture some of this is also enabled by the new image processing pipeline that they've tweaked and fiddled with that they also named photonic engine you know on stage they were saying things like 49 better low light performance which i'm not exactly sure what's meant by 49 like is it 49 faster shutter speed or 49 less noise in low light unclear but as i go through the photos i took on both i gotta say they're still remarkably similar okay again i was looking for the differences in the amount of noise in the shadows or dynamic range but really what i mostly found was slight differences in color temperature you know sometimes one might be a little brighter than the other and sometimes it's really hard to tell them apart even pixel peeping i even looked at shutter speeds which may sometimes reveal that you actually have a faster shutter speed from the bigger sensor because it's taking in more light and while i found that they were nearly the same for every shot the iphone 14 was typically maybe five to ten percent faster the one thing i did find was that in the absolute darkest shots in the worst conditions there was sometimes a difference in how much time it would require to get a night mode exposure like for this one it took 3 seconds from the 13 but 2 seconds from the 14. even though the 13 actually ended up focusing more correctly and had a bit of a sharpness advantage in this shot sometimes you just got to get the shot a little quicker if possible and then this one from the ultrawide it was a one second night mode exposure from the 13 but just a regular snap from the 14. so it's the exact same hardware i guess that's the difference for the photonic engine and image processing even so the image is a toss-up like it's a little more processing happening on the iphone 14 side maybe a little more sharpening a slightly different color cast but that's it and then on the video front it's even more similar so they take basically the same video but the iphone 14 does have a feature called action mode that's not coming to the 13s for some reason even though it feels like a software feature but it's basically a super aggressive stabilization for running around and chasing stuff on top of the already pretty good stabilization from the iphone's video and i will say the stabilization part works very well but the video itself can be quite noisy also it seems like in almost every environment it's just asking for more light all the time like you get this dialog box that says more light required but it still lets you shoot but the footage is super grainy and soft especially from the ultra wide that it defaults to but also like i'm in an incredibly well-lit studio and sometimes it would ask for more light even in here this is better lit than most people's homes where you're chasing around a baby or a pet at 100 miles an hour let alone sometimes going outside on a cloudy day and it's asking for more light that's crazy so this may get better over time as of right now it shows up less on the iphone 14 pro which makes sense because this one has a larger primary sensor but yeah the stabilization works really well it's a software feature you might use and then there is the new selfie camera it is 12 megapixels and has autofocus for the first time instead of the fixed focal distance from before you can get sharper shots in some less conventional selfie situations which is great um it's not game changingly different i mean it's another incremental improvement it can still struggle with properly reproducing darker skin tones which i mentioned in the 14 pro review here's the same shot from the pixel 6 pro which specifically has their real tone optimization so you can see what i mean so at the end of the day what are we left with a super incremental update in the same body basically as before and that's what i want to talk about that they've done a lot more recently some might call it the tim cook logistics touch see that's been the iphone se formula for years i've talked about it in those reviews so the first generation iphone se comes out it's basically the body of an old iphone 5s but with new internals then the second generation iphone se comes out it's the body of an iphone 8 but with new internals and then the third generation iphone sc again that we just got this year again is the body of an iphone 8 but even newer internals and there's rumors of the next gen sc being like the body of an iphone 10r but the new chip and we even saw that with the macbook pro this year the 13-inch m2 macbook pro is the exact same body as the 13-inch m1 macbook pro just with better internals now it's not exactly some mystery why they do this there's plenty of reasons behind the scenes why these things are good for apple it reduces risk it reduces cost because now you don't have to develop as much new stuff and then prices go down and you can offer something more tried and true that already worked in the past but to an audience that will pay less and also it sort of insulates them a little bit from the supply chain challenges of trying to make a bunch of newer stuff so the innovation aka the risk is saved for the even more expensive phones you know you watch that iphone 14 pro review and you see the dynamic island which is a thing that's new to the iphone it'll evolve over time you see the new 48 megapixel camera system which is new to the iphone and you'll see the always on display which again is the first time they've done this basically this is all just a long-winded way of saying the baseline iphone with this strategy is just boring and that's just the way it is uh so now for those who are thinking of actually buying one of these phones you're thinking oh okay i know everything about the phones i know which one i want to get but one last wrench to throw into all of this is that the iphone 13 is still on sale and it's 6.99 from apple but you can probably find it even cheaper from other places and i think that would be a fine upgrade for a lot of people like the one extra year of software updates is maybe the only reason i would get a 14 over a 13 but aside from that you really got to think about how much the new colors or the slightly new camera or satellite connectivity or crash detection actually means to you and hey if efficiency means something to you then definitely check out this video's sponsor anchor who makes these chargers and cables that i really like this is their nano 3 charger which uses gallium nitride that's why it's 70 smaller than apple's 30 watt charger and it's still powerful enough to juice up an iphone or an ipad or a macbook air if you really wanted to and this 541 cable which is usbc to lightning is the first that i've seen that uses bio-based materials in the cable so sugar cane and corn but it's still a high quality cable that can withstand up to 20 000 bends and it's actually more durable than a typical plastic cable and these both come in five colors for your choice to either match your iphone 14 or mix it up a little bit definitely check both of these out at the link below but that's been it thanks for watching let me know what you think of apple's this repackaging re-gifting strategy that they've sort of leaned into more lately either way it's september a lot more is coming up definitely subscribe if you haven't already and i'll catch you guys the next one peace [Music],"10:27 wow 😮 | Watched the iphone 14 videos and you predicted the 16e notch and here also the camera for XR. Insane 💀 | This is another inconsistency. Noticed a few with the iPhone 12 Pro long review.  The regular 14 does not have a higher res display nor slightly thinner bezels. It has the EXACT same bezels and display, same resolution as the 13. The 14 Pro is the one that jumped from 458PPI to 460 and also from 87.4% screen-to body ratio to 88.3%. | Wat about the battery 🔋? | Dont forget the notch is smaller. And they took the purple color and made it white with a faint tint of purple... unless you get the pro then they offer an actual purple. Your blue one in the video looks more purple than mine 😂 | Please give me the iPhone 13 you threw away I need it 😩😩😩😩😩 please am begging | I bought an iphone 14 in the month of January 2024. It was stolen in the month of September, I tried to locate the phone through find  my Device, which was unsuccessful. I went to India police authorities but there was poor response. Apple needs to improve it's tracking system. | Watching this on iPhone 14 😂 | I have the iPhone 14 and the eSIM is the most annoying thing in the world as a phone collector 

At this point I’m gonna switch back to the 13 just to have a physical SIM card to easily switch between android and iPhone 

Just a niche thing though | That iPhone unit is great except for one thing. The screen occasionally goes black and we have to do the troubleshooting once in awhile. We’ve had an Apple devices for years but this is the first time we had a crappy one like this."
SdLShOCvVeM,iPhone 14 Pro Review: This Will Be Copied!,iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max have 3 main new things. My honest thoughts! New Chevron Hoodie! http://shop.,2022-09-14T13:01:12Z,13011375,352546,18657,foreign [Music] [Music] 14 pro so this might be a little bit inside baseball but typically when you're testing a new product an unreleased product from Apple they tell you to keep the testing a secret don't let anyone know you have it don't display it publicly don't show it to anyone that would be breaking the NDA and that's still true about this new iPhone 14 pro but I'll tell you what I was able to walk around take pictures text people pay for things with Apple pay and nobody even blinked an eye because it looks exactly the same as the iPhone 13 Pro this is still of course a new phone though for a new year and so really there are three major things that are new with the 14 pro those being the internals the display and the cameras and so I'm going to sort of chapter those things off to go over each of them but of course also worth mentioning is this new MKBHD Edition Chevron hoodie finally finally available in the MKBHD store mkbhd.com it's very comfortable but also hoodie season [Music] yeah on and on so there's not a whole lot of new pieces in this new phone but there's technically more in this one than the Baseline iPhone 14 because this one actually gets the Silicon upgrade to the new a16 bionic and six gigs of RAM top of the line new four nanometer system on a chip from Apple you could tell though when they gave the presentation in the keynote that it must be a pretty minor bump from the a15 bionic because they went straight to comparing it to the a13 bionic from a couple years ago in real life though so far it's benchmarked very similar to an a15 bionic just slightly above as expected and that's meant for me Rock Solid performance fluid animations and are pretty reliable all-day battery life from both the 14 pro and 14 pro Max but I'm going to get more into battery in a minute also technically new to the internals is a new set of sensors it's an improved gyroscope and a better accelerometer to be able to tell if you've been in a car crash or Not Crash detection cool feature so it'll detect if you've been in a car crash or not and then if you don't respond to the prompts on screen it'll automatically call Emergency Services great I'm not going to test that I'm sure some other YouTubers will find a way to test it but actually my question really was like okay if you're going to test it what sort of things do you test and I guess the answer is accidental triggers like you know how you'll if you run up a flight of stairs or something and you have automatic workout detection on the Apple watch it'll go oh have you started a workout because you've got an elevated heart rate and you just started to running no just me I don't know I was just wondering if there's other times I might accidentally think that's something else like a car crash might have happened maybe you've got a dbrand case on it and you just drop it on the floor or something I don't know it hits the ground hard enough thinks it might have crashed but then the more you look at it the more you realize there's a bunch of different sensors and factors where it sees okay your GPS location was going 60 miles an hour until it hit zero miles an hour and the microphones heard a loud noise and the barometric pressure changed when the airbags went off and also the gyroscope saw that there was a hard stopping force it knows you run a car crash one more thing that used to be in the iPhone that's not anymore and this one is a physical SIM card tray this is actually for the US only and these phones are now e-sim only esim isn't exactly a new thing but not having a physical SIM tray anymore does have its pros and cons pros mainly being okay it's one less place for water to get in one less moving part but cons being that for international travel if you just wanted to grab a SIM card real quick instead of going through the carriers that's no longer nearly as easy I'm going to keep an eye on this because I imagine Apple intends to eventually expand this to all iPhones instead of what it's now which is just starting in the US only but then the last internal change for the iPhone 14s all of them is satellite connectivity this is an edge case extra feature that you're honestly hoping you never ever have to use but in the off chance that you're stranded somewhere with absolutely no cellular service at all you're nowhere near a cell tower the iPhone's antenna is now impressively can also communicate with straight up satellites instead of cell towers so it'll take longer and you'll need a clear view of the sky and the UI will literally help you point your phone at a certain satellite overhead but it will let you send messages to a dispatcher or local emergency services to help get to your location and what you need help with that is also pretty clutch I will also not be testing that but that's it for internals uh notice I didn't talk much about the externals like I usually do in phone reviews because if we're being honest they're pretty much the same uh there are some new colors the space black which is my favorite in years and there's also a new purple color from certain angles you can hardly even tell it's purple but if it hits the light you know for a pro phone that's a solid purple I guess really only the camera bumps change they are definitely slightly larger and thicker than the 13 Pros but bottom line is when an iPhone 13 Pro can fit in an iPhone 14 Pro's case and you know it's pretty close in return okay so now we're really getting into the meat of what you really start to notice on these new phones iPhone 14 pro and 14 pro Max have some slightly updated 6.1 inch and 6.7 inch OLED displays respectively so there's still excellent displays on paper with slightly thinner bezels that you won't notice and slightly higher resolution that you also won't notice and an even higher brighter 2000 nits Peak brightness that you absolutely will notice when looking at the phone on like a bright sunny day it looks great at 100 out in the sun but the two things you'll notice the most often here are the dynamic Island and the always-on display the always-on display is the perfect example of the classic apple late mover strategy like this is not a new feature this has been on hundreds of phones before for many years but now it's finally coming to an iPhone and so it's being done the apple way this time the thing is I don't really know that there's any advantages to this apple way so the always on display looks like this so you hit the power button you sleep the phone you put it down the brightness drops the ltpo OLED display goes all the way down to one Hertz and you get to see the clock and notifications roll in as if your lock screen is still on just at a lower brightness this is a pretty bright always-on display though you can see that right like it you get used to it after a few days but I constantly was looking over at my phone on my desk thinking it was still on which is like a lower brightness but yeah it looks like that all the time the transition from the home screen to the always on display is really nice it's got this smooth fade animation and I think that's the Apple Way like the clock if it's behind something will graduate to the front of the oasan display and it maintains all the colors and skin tones and whatever wallpaper you were using so it's not faded or black and white you still have all your color if you've got music playing then your album art is front and center it is extra beautiful but I don't really care about any of that to be honest and there's also no extra customization like I've seen some really creative always-on displays over the years that let me customize and dial in even differently from the lock screen and I really love using them apples is just a toggle in the display settings on or off that's it me personally I'm gonna be turning it off on this phone because it also seems to be affecting battery life slightly more than I expected now the always-on display specifically doesn't show up in the battery settings so I'm kind of just estimating here based on my behavior everything else looks normal but I am getting slightly worse battery life than I've expected and then I've had on the 13 Pro for the past year and so I assume that's this that's a little extra brightness gone a long way it does still know when to turn off don't get me wrong if it's in a pocket it turns off if you're in sleep mode it turns off even when you have an Apple Watch on and you walk far enough away from the phone that it knows you can't see it anymore it turns off the always-on display but it does just sit here on my desk all day showing me stuff and I I don't really use it all that much so yeah I'm gonna pass but you know what is new on the screen that I absolutely love and will never pass on the dynamic Island baby what a terrible name they felt the need to name the notch it is such a minor feature in the grand scheme of using a phone but it's a good one it's a really good one so here's what's happening remember the rumors of the new Pro iPhone replacing the notch with an eye shaped cutout in the top of the display with all those renders people made well that's actually what this is it has one circular cut out on the right for a new selfie camera and one pill-shaped cutout on the left for the new face ID Hardware which they've shrunk down by about 30 percent to fill in this smaller area and then instead of just doing that Apple has cleverly decided to fill in the gap between them with black pixels and make it one big pill so then the idea is Apple would much rather think about the pill as software than Hardware so they built a whole bunch of software features around it so it just has a resting state like this which doesn't show up in screenshots or screen recordings it's just a gap but there are about 30 different things that it does to indicate ongoing activities and background activities and things that are all beautifully animated and super smooth these fluid physics it's so friendly and approachable and all of these things that it does show up in screenshots and Screen recordings the best part is pretty much everything works straight out the box as you'd expect it to so I had this moment during the first impressions video where I was like oh can't wait for Apple music to use it but then Spotify to take like a year and a half to actually update their app to work with this but nope everything works straight out the box including Spotify because that already uses the now playing API they already had a lock screen widget same with SoundCloud same with YouTube music and Pocket Casts so you have album art and the color matching waveform up there while the media is playing if you tap it it'll open the app that's playing and if you long press it you actually get a widget that pops up with some media controls I can scrub and everything pretty much the exact same widget that would appear in the lock screen so this feels kind of backwards I think a tap should open the widget and then a long press should open the app and that would just make more sense but whatever the point is it just works right off the rip matter of fact here's everything that the dynamic Island does right out the box on day one so it does system alerts like for incoming calls connecting air pods plugging into a charger switching the ringer to silent mode or volume on face ID unlocking connecting air pods and a whole bunch more there's our full list and then it's also a UI for live activities happening in the background so an ongoing call or music playing in the background any media a timer counting down Maps directions as you navigate in the background what voice memos recording screen recording all that stuff so here's a full list of that as well and then any third-party app that uses the now playing or call Kit apis which there are many it also has a little spot for the indicator for microphone and camera access right in between the pill and the cutout it really becomes next level when you have multiple background activities happening at once because then it low-key kind of becomes like a multitasking app switcher at the top of your phone so one background activity looks like this but then if I have a second one if I go start a new background activity it splits the island into two so now you can pick between them and then quickly swap between them with a single touch that's so sick I think as cheesy as the name is like I'm about done saying the words Dynamic Island out loud but I think this will be one of the most copied features in the smartphone World in like 18 months pretty much guarantee it like we even already saw some MIUI mods on Twitter where people trying this on other phones but the thing is it's going to be surprisingly hard to copy it exactly like this on this level it seems pretty innocuous pretty simple but there is a lot going on here like there's a new display engine in the a16 bionic that handles all these animations and there's a lot of them that really pull this whole thing together there's physics to it you just you poke the cut out and it wobbles and moves around a little like it's alive and since there are real cutouts like holes in the display for the camera and the face ID system it has to be touch sensitive in areas around the actual cutout so that it can still register Taps when you touch a dead zone on the screen and for the most part it works pretty well is this a game changing feature in a phone for most people no is this a reason to get one phone over another I don't think so no not really is this a nice quality of life touch that a lot of people will think is really cool and really like yeah yeah I think that's true is this feature technically invented by LG seven years ago with the top screen on the LG V10 yes absolutely [Music] all right if you watch enough iPhone presentations then you know that the pro iPhone really is and has been all about the cameras fun fact they spent 23 minutes on stage at the September event talking about the iPhone 14 pro and seven of those minutes about 33 percent we're just talking about the camera and so this is the biggest change at least on paper that's been made to the iPhone camera in many years look at this graph this is a graph of the megapixel count of every iPhone camera since they first came out they've been confidently repeating the 12 megapixel sensors since the iPhone 6s but this year we got a leap we got the leap the primary camera on the iPhone 14 pro is now a new 48 megapixel sensor it's 65 percent larger than the one we had on the 12 Pro it has a second generation Focus Shift Optical image stabilization 100 Focus pixels and sits behind a new f 1.78 lens I think we can all agree that's a great set of specs that we expect great imagery from but really The more I've been playing with it it's just more about what the new 48 megapixel sensor enables that's so great so a new larger 48 megapixel sensor that's going to bend down to 12 megapixels for all your normal photos but you do get the benefits of sharpness and more light Gathering From a larger sensor that also gives you faster shutter speeds to freeze motion more often in non-perfect conditions and it lets me take low light photos with a shorter shutter time which is very convenient but the larger sensor also gives you a really nice shallow natural depth of field without portrait mode more than we've ever seen from an iPhone camera now other phones I've seen do this just as well but it presents a new set of challenges like fringing and autofocus but I've been very impressed with how well the iPhone deals with both not a whole ton of fringing on close-up subjects and 100 coverage with Focus pixels has been pretty locked in on tracking subjects and keeping things in Focus even with the shallow depth of field my only complaint really is the pretty weak minimum Focus distance things get blurred when you get close to the primary camera so you got to switch to the macro mode pretty early luckily the ultra wide has some improvements too so that's not the end of the world then a 48 megapixel sensor also enables this new 2x button doesn't seem like that huge of a deal but it's literally just cropping in on the middle 12 megapixels of this huge sensor so it's essentially like an optical zoom it's not like you're going to lose quality the way anything less than 3x would have been before on iPhones because it was cropping into an already 12 megapixel image the 48 megapixel sensor also enables this new action mode and video which is this super aggressive stabilization for really shaky video and it does this with a pretty heavy crop but it's also able to still shoot in up to 2.8 K in this mode a little Pro tip it defaults to the 0.5 x camera it's much noisier when you do this so so I I do recommend switching back to the primary for it and then if you're running around chasing a subject or even pulling it out a car window or just anytime you need some pretty heavy stabilization this is definitely nice to have if you want the full 48 megapixel files you can shoot in Pro raw and it will kick out 50 60 70 megabyte dng files which have a lot of detail and latitude to push around in Lightroom and make them look better than the straight out of Camera 12 megapixel shots but I'll leave that to the Peter McKinnon's and Tyler stalman's or many other photography creators I know are going to put this to the test one thing they didn't do with the new 48 megapixel sensor is 8k video they could have they've not been able to until they crossed the 30 megapixel threshold they got to 48 they didn't do it that of course would also probably still be pretty tough considering the max iPhone is still one terabyte which sounds like a lot but then you're also working with huge five six gig per minute prores files that take forever to get off the iPhone via this lightning port in the slow speeds and they should probably just switch to USBC and that's a whole rant for another day so I'll just stop it there but just know no AK video straight from the iPhone's camera I think I can honestly safely though put the iPhone 14 pro as the best camera system in any phone in 2022. don't get me wrong it's not perfect it can definitely over bake HDR sometimes in some harsh shooting conditions and the new selfie camera which now has 12 megapixels and autofocus while it handles a variety of focal lengths much better and is sharper overall it still has a tendency to overexpose people with dark skin constantly I would know but if I'm just looking for the overall versatility of the whole camera system you know the shutter speed improvements the quality of the photos the great autofocus the color consistency between the three different cameras the overall image processing pipeline improvements that have made the ultra wide much more usable and less noisy and low light and then of course the prores video that I'm literally actively running an entire YouTube channel with then yeah I'm pretty comfortable calling this the camera King again and yes I am going to be shooting the new autofocus video with the iPhone 14 Pros cameras so if you want to large helping of sample footage that's going to be the place to go go subscribe over there plus the car is going to be that's a fun one it's going to be a good video so don't miss it anyway oh also guess what guess what cinematic mode now supports 30 FPS huh that's funny Checkmate 24 FPS stands uh no but also I don't think I'm gonna be using cinematic mode that much because the natural depth of field is so good on the primary camera but yeah 30 FPS cinematic now also remember how all those event invites went out a couple weeks ago and the theme was far out and there were all these stars and we thought oh they're going to get an astrophotography mode like a nighttime photography type thing uh that didn't happen turned out they were like hinting at the satellite connectivity but like the iPhone still gets crushed when it comes to some of the like super low light nighttime shooting and especially astrophotography so I'm kind of bummed that we didn't get that but otherwise yeah complete camera [Music] so the iPhone 14 pro is still a thousand dollars and the 14 pro Max is still eleven hundred dollars to start so they are the absolute best phones Apple makes right now and there's going to be a lot of people considering an upgrade so is it worth it well in the landscape of other phones you could get for one thousand dollars this one's gonna be competitive it's going to have the best camera of the bunch I think uh it's gonna have one of the best brightest most responsive displays of any of those phones it's also going to have a dynamic Island however you feel about that but also it's going to have the classic Suite of iPhone stuff iMessage FaceTime Classics but there definitely isn't any any flashy or any Crazy Design or Hardware Innovation Happening Here There is nothing folding in half there is no super fast charging or some massive battery size Improvement the new colors which you've seen are like yeah you can kind of tell that they're a little different looking but this is a very refined update and so really the truth is if you have an iPhone 11 or later at this point then the new iOS 16 update pushing out to your phone right now is gonna make just as big of a difference to the user experience of using your phone as getting the new phone probably would so yeah I'd say you know the new lock screen the haptic keyboard all this stuff I did a video on all the new features you can check that out but yeah this is a really good phone you should get it if you either want the latest and greatest and best of a smartphone camera available right now or if you've just got a thousand dollar hole in your pocket burning away and you just have to have the latest and greatest pro iPhone that's what this is if you're not trying to get the newest iPhone then you can skip the upgrade it and fix your current phone with parts and tools by this video's sponsor iFixit they make it super easy with free repair guides and tear Downs on their channel it's not as hard as it looks also if you want to see the inside of your phone before you try to fix it check out ifixit's channel so you can see their iPhone 14 tear down when they take apart Tech so you can learn how to fix it yourself so you can check them out at the link below one sustainability note I found interesting the iPhone 14s now across the board have a slightly improved repairability design the glass on the back is now separate from the components underneath very nice but either way that's been it thanks for watching definitely get subscribed to see the straight up standard iPhone 14 review and that comes out also the Apple watch Ultra and that comes out and about a thousand other things that are all working on here at the studio because it's Tech Timber there's a lot happening see you in the next one peace [Music],"11:10 connecting airpods x2 | I think the intro music was changed.

H8PLt4lG-tY,The Ultimate Pocket Camera: Insta360 X3!,"Welcome to my pocket camera arsenal, X3! The Auto Focus channel: ...",2022-09-09T18:59:05Z,3180330,103069,2862,this video is sponsored by insta360. so this tiny camera has basically one great trick that makes it the most versatile camera that i've ever used so there's been action cameras and 360 cameras for a while now i've tried some on and off for a few years but insta360 asked to sponsor a look at their latest highest quality most fully featured version yet this is the x3 and i'm really glad i did so here's how it works this camera body has two half inch high resolution sensors back to back so they're each recording a super wide angle video that stretches way back actually a little beyond 180 degrees and so since each camera goes a bit beyond 180 there's a little overlap at the seams and then the camera does the work to stitch the two feeds together into one and then even better since it knows where the mounting point is it knows where a selfie stick would be and it can stitch that out of the video and then of course it knows its own exact dimension so can also stitch itself out of the shot so essentially it creates this invisible ball of 360 degree video capturing goodness which is pretty sick but honestly the how it works isn't nearly as interesting as what it actually enables you to do so check this out you pair it up to your phone right you can see what the camera is pointed at which is me and then when i start moving it it stays pointed at me so they named this flow state stabilization basically it's using ai to find a horizon and keep that level and locking on a target somewhere in that sphere of video and now you're really getting an idea of the power of this camera this isn't something you get just to shoot spherical video really this is a sphere of video where you can choose any piece of that sphere to point at and use and that's what makes this the most versatile camera i've ever seen so this x3 is the latest version here to shoot this way it has a new half inch sensor like i said it can shoot 5.7 k 360 video with hdr or 8k time lapses if you want it has a new 2.3 inch touchscreen with tempered glass and the whole thing is waterproof up to 33 feet with an ipx8 rating with an 1800 milliamp hour removable battery inside and so then the whole insta 360 advantage the whole thing is the ability to take advantage of the fact that it's always shooting this whole sphere of video all the time so if you can picture it you're just holding a ball of 360 degree video and you can put it wherever you want so that opens up a massive world of possibilities so let me show you some of the things you can do ranging from the simplest to the craziest and most impressive so the simple one is called me mode you've probably seen this one before you can hold out the camera on a selfie stick and it tracks you and focuses on you automatically this is already kind of wild that it looks like there's just a camera floating out in front of you it can kind of look like a pseudo drone shot if you move it around over your head enough but it's basically just stitching out the selfie stick and it can export a regular looking widescreen video from a crazy perspective so then okay there's what i like to call gta mode which is basically using the extended selfie stick mounted to a vehicle so that it's basically floating off the back and thanks to tracking it has this sick like first person view of an actual car driving down an actual street you might have seen some of these shots on instagram at least i know i have i really like though this next one which is called first person mode this is something i'm actually gonna start using more on the autofocus channel that we just started because believe it or not holding a phone in one hand while driving down the highway with the other is not actually the safest thing to do so all you have to do for first person is put the camera either on your head or literally hold it in your mouth and then track the part of the sphere that faces forward and boom not only do you have a first person wide angle shot of what i'm seeing as i drive but it's super out of the way and it's very useful fun fact the other side of the sphere looks like this some people have called this nose mode you might have seen some clips like this also all over the internet but probably the craziest thing i've seen in this software is something called bullet time this is just literally swinging this camera around your head on a string so insta360 actually makes a cord just for this feature it's got a quarter twenty score at the end you connect them and you swing the camera around in slow motion and it can make some pretty sweet videos kind of an advanced selfie showing off your environment in 360 degrees so it's a pretty complex system that's very capable the craziest part of all this is that it's all edited on your phone it's all done in the insta360 app so that makes it this sort of next level of accessible i've been talking about starting youtube channel on your phone making videos on your phone you can do all this with the camera and one app on your phone and render times are not bad either so just going through a clip you shot on this camera and asking it to track something it tracks faster than real time which is sick and you can do a whole sky swap of a video clip in a few seconds it just analyzes the whole clip and then does a pretty solid convincing sky swap and if you think about it at all it is much faster much faster than any adobe app or motion graphics tool that i've tried but the whole point is any effect you want to achieve can be done within the app so whether it's something super complex like bullet time or just some simple reframing just moving around that sphere of video using keyframing and even using the gyroscope of your phone to point at new things and adjust your shot it all works very smoothly no matter what you always have the whole sphere to play with and you can move around and create a custom video of whatever angles you want super quickly you can get really creative with it so this is a 449 camera and the app on your phone and a selfie stick and that's it that's the whole system so i'm going to be adding this to the arsenal for the autofocus channel for sure there is also some accessories there's this guy which is a reader accessory so instead of having to take out the battery which is removable to get to the micro sd card you can just plug it straight into your phone and grab files that way there is also a mic jack accessory so you can plug in via usbc and then there's a mic jack so things to like sort of add a little bit of production quality to this camera that's already pretty solid on its own and there's also other smart features like loop recording which records every 30 minutes and you can use it as a dash cam so are there any weaknesses basically the only one that i've found is with a 360 setup like this with back-to-back cameras if you put the subject right on this seam like on the edge of where the two cameras are recording or it's stitching them together you can get some distortion especially if you're very close to the camera but it's pretty easy to shoot around that it's easy to change the orientation to just make sure somewhere in the sphere is the subject and then you're good so yeah realistically this is the most versatile camera i've ever seen and actually used and honestly i don't even scratch the surface of the creativity that i've seen people do with these cameras again all over my instagram feed i've seen people like throwing this around doing fake drone shots i saw somebody actually throw it off of a cliff next to somebody who was diving and it just fell into the water but of course the spear captured the person diving right next to the camera just cool stuff so naturally i'm going to be bringing this into autofocus videos first person driving shots maybe selfie stick outside of the car stuff things like that but go ahead and subscribe over there if you want to see that stuff i'll have a link below to the channel also have a link below to the camera itself and thanks again to insta360 for sponsoring this look but that's pretty much been it thanks for watching and i'll catch you guys in the next one peace [Music] [Music] [Music],"Never to buy Insta360 action cameras. The camera one rs is just 2 years old, and they've discontinued the battery, spares. Really??? What do i with these cameras, or buy a new insta360 cameras every fews year.

N8M8OOe3SV4,Apple Watch Ultra Impressions: Polished Overkill!,"The Apple Watch Ultra was just unveiled, and it's positively thiccc Check out the iPhone 14 hands-on: ...",2022-09-08T22:10:04Z,5165639,157694,6616,[Music] what's up MKBHD here so by Clockwork Apple just unveiled a bunch of new stuff at their September event iPhone and iPhone accessories my video about the new iPhone 14 series is already live link below that like button go watch it over there if you want a look at those this video is on the iPhone accessories which low-key I think I think were more interesting than the iPhones themselves so first we got the new airpods Pro still 249 dollars like the last ones and still basically the same design but a lot of internal improvements add up to a potentially much better experience so there's new drivers the new H2 chip inside there's two times stronger noise cancellation a new longer six hour battery life on a single charge and touch volume controls on the stocks where the force touch sensors are and there's even a new adaptive transparency mode basically just building on Apple's gigantic lead with their already god-like transparency mode by detecting like extra loud noises and trimming them so so if you walk past the construction zone the mics aren't going to pump in the super loud Jackhammer noises but the best thing honestly is probably the new case I think basically Apple just realized how often people lose the case including myself so it's a lot easier now to not lose it or to find it so there's a hook on the side for Lanyards now plus I added a speaker on the bottom so you can find it when it's lost by emitting a sound and it's all now in a fully magsafe compatible case that can also now charge with an Apple Watch charger the earbud Wars are spicy right now there's a lot of good options out there these are obviously on the pricier end but given how good they sound quality is how good the transparency mode is and how well it works with the iPhone these will probably do pretty well but I'm going to review them I'm going to check them out but what you're really here for is the new Apple watch lineup because that's what I titled the video but that's also the most interesting stuff so that is the new Apple watch SE a new Apple watch series 8 and a new Apple watch Ultra so the Apple watch SE slots in at the bottom of the lineup at 250 bucks to replace the old Watch series 3 that they were still selling and it's better in pretty much every way it's got a redesigned color matching back case a 30 larger screen than that old watch and the S8 sip that makes a lot of sense then the Apple Watch series 8 is in the middle it's a very minor but very reasonable upgrade to the series seven so it's in the same design it gives it a new temperature sensor which is useful for advanced cycle tracking and retrospective ovulation estimates for women it gives it some new GeForce sensors for crash detection so it can automatically tell when you've been in a car crash and it can call for help if you don't respond to the prompt on the screen no idea how I'm going to test that but I believe you and it gives it a new low power mode that can help extend battery life when you're in a pinch boom same price 3.99 for GPS only 4.99 for cellular cool but then there's a new watch at the high end the Apple watch Ultra it basically looks like they uh took a regular Apple watch and sent it to the gym so the result is a beefed up 49 millimeter watch it's the biggest bra brightest display ever in an Apple Watch which can get up to 2 000 nits the display up top is flat and has just just a tiny bit of a lip on the edge to protect the sapphire crystal cover and the digital crown on the side is bigger and thicker with this added Crown guard and a button that sticks out for even normal so it's easier to hit with gloves on then on the other side there's a second speaker and additional microphones added for additional volume and better mic quality and windy environments there's a new button a big bright orange action button this is a customizable button that you can set to do any number of different things like starting a workout or letting up the whole screen white to be a flashlight and then while you're in an app it can serve different functions inside that app and by the way this is the only spec there's only one Apple watch Ultra just this titanium and ceramic they all have cellular and they all have this bright orange action button so you know aesthetically it feels like you know when we first saw these rumors of a pro watch maybe coming they really could only go go two ways they could start with a super ruggedized military-grade Garmin level watch and then try to bring it down and like amplify it or they could start with a regular Apple watch and ruggedize that and they clearly went with option two which makes for this chunky looking Apple watch but still a pretty familiar looking watch what's notable though is it doesn't feel heavy the titanium made it actually feel much lighter on the wrist than I expected so yeah while it's definitely easier to call this one a chunker it's it's thick with maybe three or even four C's just know it it could have definitely been bigger now there's a bunch of features you know how I think they made this watch I think they they took a bunch of extreme high performance athletes and asked them all how many of you use an Apple Watch and the ones that raised their hand and said I don't use the watch it just can't hang with me they took those people brought them to Apple Park and interrogated them to figure out what they needed to change about the Apple watch to make it keep up with what they do so they for sure talk to some divers who are definitely like yeah this thing is it's waterproof but it's not waterproof enough to go down way as low as I go and be a dive computer and then Apple went and made this watch wr100 water resistant so you can dive down theoretically to 100 meters with it and through extra sensors in there to make it a real proper dive computer for a lot of people I think they talk to Mountaineers who hike in like white out conditions and then from that you get extreme temperature ruggedness you get the ability to add waypoints in the compass app so if you ever need to find your way back someplace that you can't visually see you can always use the watch for it and they tossed in an 86 decibel siren from the new larger speaker which is Extremely Loud and can sort of send out an SOS signal to people nearby and also uh dual band GPS this is a feature you don't see as often as smart watches but can massively improve accuracy and also help out if you're going through some GPS dead zones I think they talked to marathoners who probably all just said yeah the watch dies before the end of a normal Marathon so I can't use it and then of course the ultra now with its new thicker case has room for much more battery how much more exactly well on stage Apple said 36 hours and they also said 18 hours about the normal Apple watch so I'm just doing the mental math of like how long this normally lasts me which is about a day and a half and so the ultra is double so it feels like with normal use it can be about a three day battery and then they also said it could get up to 60 hours with the new battery optimization feature that's not coming till later this year I don't know exactly what that means or what it will entail but if I just do the math again that could net out to about five days of regular use with that mode on but that's that's purely theoretical at this point I definitely have to use it but either way they claim that marathoner can now not only finish a marathon but they can do an entire Iron Man which is a two and a half mile swim a hundred mile bike ride and a 27 mile marathon back to back and track the whole thing with heart rate and GPS with battery to spare that is impressive so this is definitely living up to the ultra name no question about that and I know when we all see these features we start to think about pricing a little bit so again there were some rumors there were some talks that this might end up being like a thousand dollar watch to start which seemed crazy at first to me but then I had flashbacks of like that ten thousand dollar gold Apple watch Edition so it wasn't entirely out of the aroma possibility but it turns out this one is actually priced entirely reasonably it starts at actually there's only one price One spec but it's 7.99 that's still pricey obviously but that just for context uh Garmin Phoenix a very competitive popular smart watch is 900 bucks uh 800 bucks I think for for the smallest one but Apple's not usually the one doing the undercutting but then on top of that there were also some new faces and bands specifically for this Ultra watch uh the way finder faces are pretty sweet and give just a lot of relevant information to someone who might be in the middle of something like hiking you know there's a compass elevation Etc and then there's three special new watch bands a Trail Loop for endurance athletes the Alpine Loop and The Ocean band for high-speed water sports all of these are pretty unique and actually very impressive both durability wise and comfort wise like these are really good bands and so fun fact I was just kind of wondering and I had to actually check I did take the bands off of the ultra and put them on the smaller watches and they seem to work just fine so just from this experience audience I'm going to say that it seems like backwards compatibility with the bands is a green light so the number one question I've been getting since this announcement is am I gonna get one like okay it's for explorers Adventures endurance athletes a lot of you guys know I play Ultimate Frisbee and I do wear my watch while playing and practicing most of the time so am I in the Target demographic for this uh yes and no I you know they showed a couple obvious examples mountaineering biking Iron Mans and things like that for me like I would love the extra battery life and for certain workouts and things like that having better GPS and being able to do more workouts before the thing dies would be nice but it's for me like it's still an everyday watch it's an Apple Watch like you still have to wear it all the rest of the time too and for me it is approaching the sort of like too big to be able to pull off normally on the wrist it's not huge obviously I couldn't wear a garment every day either I don't think with my skinny wrists but like fun fact I wore this black Apple watch to the Met Gala and I think it was okay like it turned out fine you can dress it up hide it under a cuff but I don't think you can do all that with the ultra here's how I think of it on the waveform podcast this week Andrew my co-host said I think he explained it kind of perfectly with the summary which is the Apple watch Ultra is like the GoPro of Apple watches you see a cool commercial and you think oh that is sick like this super durable camera is going to capture my Amazing Adventures I'm gonna have the sickest footage ever and then you get one and then you use it maybe once or twice and the footages are right and then it just kind of sits in a drawer Gathering dust and this watch most people don't need but it would be sick like the commercials are sick and I think if you are one of those athletes who I was just talking about in this video like you're definitely going to be able to take advantage of the watch but for most people also the regular Apple watch will be fine and for me it probably will my biggest annoyance with all the watches actually is something that Casey neistat actually just brought up on Twitter which is literally just that if it's if you're sweating a lot or if it's raining or if you've got long sleeves during a workout it tends to mess with the screen it touches the screen even if you have theater mode on it just lights up the screen and messes with the workout Data Tracking I want them to just fix that and I'd be cool with probably any of the watches but for the extreme for the adventurers and for those with Deep Pockets this is going to be a pretty sick watch this is it's very it's competitive with a lot of the other rugged eye smart watches out there but it's key Advantage being it's also an Apple Watch you can also wear it every day and it's also going to work really well with that iPhone that you probably already have so that's what Ultra that's it for the video thanks for watching let me know what you think too if the if the ultra is right for you if you have a certain situation you use it in all right catch you guys later peace [Music],"Did you not do a video for the series 8? | For the last point about touching the screen when you don’t want to, isn’t they also what water mode is for? I turn that on and if it’s in my pocket it won’t lock me out for hours. | I’m still just mind blown at how as small as the AirPod Pros are, they can still get six hours or battery life on a single charge. Like… that Tiny battery in that tiny stem powers this thing for that long!? 
I consider it a huge engineering feat. My mind just can’t comprehend that. | And for some reason, you never stopped using the ultra since then LOL 😂 | I recently bought one and i love ❤️ it | Apple needs to add solar power! | I got my ultra because the regular size watch is to small for me, it takes my 2x as long to send a text with the small face. The ultra screen is a absolute beauty and makes navigating EASY! Makes checking emails easy, music easy, going for walks, reading info all EASY with the ultra. Ultra is more than just for extreme athletes it’s for those with large fingers like myself | I just like it because the screen is flat lol | Hello, nows some one, what the background from the Macbook in the Minute  4:49 ? Thanks | If they would just allow the button to not be orange 😢"
PEFUuP3eWCc,Google Pixel Buds Pro Review: Just Get These!,Pixel Buds Pro are excellent across the board... spoiler alert MKBHD Merch: http://shop.MKBHD.com Buy the Google Pixel Buds ...,2022-08-30T21:49:10Z,3805170,128132,4099,[Music] so the pixel buds a series the cheapest ones right now cost 69 nice but the old retired 2020 pixel buds before they stopped being sold were 179 dollars and i really like them i reviewed them i thought they were nice but they did lack active noise cancellation and so they sort of fell a tiny step behind the most premium best wireless earbuds that were out and so i mentioned this at the end of my review this is exactly what i said maybe later they'll do a some next-gen or a more premium pixel buds pro and they'll be 279 and they'll do a noise cancellation and a bigger battery and it turns out well that's exactly what we have here this is pixel buds pro active noise cancellation larger battery except they're only 1.99 and actually if you're cool with any color other than coral they're literally already on sale on amazon for less than the price of the last pixel buds so just to get out of the way right off the top these have nailed it from every single turn from the case to the fit to the sound to the features you probably just close this video right now and just pick up these but don't do that because then you'd ruin the watch time on this video and then that's no fun so how about how about i take you along and i'll show you why these are so good so first of all the case that these come in is basically the same as before which is to say underrated like so many wireless headphones have annoyingly thick or larger cases this is a nice compact clean well-made case sure the white might get a little dirty after a while but it's got this super satisfying magnet to open and close it is ipx2 splash resistant as a case and it has a usbc port at the bottom but also has wireless charging so you can pop it on any qi wireless charger you already have or on the back your phone if it supports power sharing and that's all in a package that fits in the coin pocket in my jeans an all-around absolute win in the case but it's what's inside the case that we're here for and the pixel buds pro have this new shape to them they're mostly a matte black plastic and they have a sort of colored cap at the end that's either fog colored which is what i have it's kind of a light blue or coral a yellowish green or black so just like any other wireless earbuds you pop them out of the case you give them a quarter twist to lock them into your ears and while they don't stick out of my ears too bad like maybe the sony wf-1000xm4s it isn't the lowest profile i've ever seen either it's somewhere in between just a little bit bigger than the last pixel buds but the main difference for me is these don't have the wing tips anymore the wing tips have their upside in the downside the upside is they would absolutely stay locked in my ear much better i could run around and jump and they wouldn't fall out but the tip of it when it was in my ear for more than about an hour or two would create this pressure point that would get more uncomfortable over time and i didn't really like that too much so these don't have that anymore which means they're not quite as locked in my ear but they are more comfortable of course earbuds are different for everybody and when i switch to the larger earbud tips like they really do still stay in my ear fine for walking around normal everyday activities and things like that but yeah that's worth noting honestly i think this is the right move also the buds themselves are ipx4 rated so if you still want to work out in them they're sweat proof but i just probably won't so once it's paired up and these are in your ears there are a lot of different features in here thanks to the pixel buds app but i'm just going to start with the sound you just listen to music how do they sound and i think these sound really really good now i'll spare you the bunch of descriptors and audio file terms that i could use just to tell you basically i really like the sound from these new 11 millimeter drivers once you get a nice seal in your ear you can tell they're really crisp and clear they aren't too shrill or tinny they don't distort very much and the noise cancellation does a great job of getting rid of white noise and there's basically no perceivable bluetooth lag at all when watching videos or gaming there's just two slightly odd things that i noticed one these just have a much stronger bass than the last pixel buds i kind of noted that as a weakness in the previous pixel buds review like they were a little bit weak on the bass not these the bass on these is so much stronger and punchier and just a more full low end that it's a real character highlight like so hip hop music anything with a lot of that lower end frequency sounds really good but in like podcasts or other genres or just things where i don't need all that bass i was looking for an eq to even that out but the pixel buds app doesn't have eq and the pixel phone also doesn't have an eq i actually got a buds firmware update while i was testing these and i thought it was about to add an eq in the sound settings but all it added was this volume eq setting which basically just makes things a little punchier at lower volumes so if you do specifically want to adjust the sound signature of these maybe your phone has eq settings built in some of them do maybe the app you're using for audio has eq settings built in some of them do but yeah pixel buds themselves don't have eq built in yet and neither does a pixel phone but google has thankfully said that there is a full five band eq coming later this year hopefully soon but then the second thing i noticed is these also have a slightly lower overall volume than any other buds i've tested in a while it's not problematically low but i did find myself almost always listening either right below max volume or like two to three notches below the max volume because that was the comfortable listening level usually max volume is way too loud for more than a few seconds of listening on most earbuds but not here it feels like it feels like the bottom 40 of the volume slider is basically useless i can barely hear anything that's that low but yeah i am definitely impressed by how little distortion there is and how clear and thumpy and great it sounds at or near max volume so that's worth noting every pair of noise-cancelling earbuds shall have a transparency mode at least seems like they all should it's like an unwritten rule of these things yeah these are transparency mode built into the pixel buds pro and it's okay it's gonna let in sound from the microphones and pump in your ambient noise so you can hear what's around you but it's not the best i guess airpods are still in a league of their own when it comes to this but i'd rate these transparency mode like a b minus basically it's better than leaving them off but it certainly still sounds muffled and i'm hoping i'm hoping stuff like this gets better in the future i hope they can push firmware updates to also improve transparency mode but the pixel buds real advantage to me is still definitely the software and all the features that are built in i still love having google assistant like a hold away or a tap away anytime i want to ask a question i literally just hold it down and say how tall is the taj mahal it's like a superpower i can just just start opening light shades and turning on smart lamps and things and just yeah assistant everywhere is great and in the pixel buds app in the settings you can customize what a tap and hold on each side does so right now i have the right side hold to trigger the assistant but the left side hole toggles between noise cancellation and transparency mode pretty much every pair of earbuds nowadays also has some sort of touch controls on the outside for your media these are no different it's touch wants to play touch two times to skip forward three times to go back the one thing i couldn't quite get to work as smoothly as i'd like is swiping to change volume these they're just not a big enough surface for me to like reliably get a good swipe in i kept trying to do it but this was like the most inconsistent thing for me basically i just end up like wobbling it around in my ear it works sometimes but again it's not a big surface so what i ended up doing is i just end up reaching in my pocket and blindly like changing the volume on the volume rocker on the phone in my pocket which turned out to actually be totally fine as long as my phone was on me so and there's a bunch of other features too multi-device support so these buds are paired to both my phone and my laptop at the same time and seamlessly switch back and forth as advertised no problem i love that and then they have a find my device feature in case they get lost they have in-ear detection to automatically play and pause when you take them out and put them back in and they even have this ear tip seal check feature which analyzes how well the microphones are actually canceling out sound for you and if it's not working so well it can recommend a different size ear tip to improve the seal it's smart the only thing missing might be the like adaptive sound feature which listens to your environment and then automatically bumps up the volume when your environment gets louder i didn't really use that very much but i noticed it wasn't here so that isn't in the pixel buds pro but it's also apparently coming other than that it's not really missing anything like these have every feature that i'm used to having with earbuds and the cherry on top as they did also with this slightly larger body improve battery life so you're going to get seven hours of actual listening with active noise cancellation on which is far longer than i would ever listen to earbuds that's up to you if you want to do that 11 hours with anc off that's a huge advantage so for 199 should you just get these probably yeah i mean this is easy to recommend there are some other options out there so for around this price you're looking at you could definitely get air pods if you're into that but you can also look towards if you specifically want better sound there are better sounding earbuds but also something like samsung's new buds 2 or pro they're 229. i haven't gotten the chance to hear them yet because they just came out and samsung didn't send me any but i imagine considering how good the previous ones were that those might also be really good and then also as far as like working out in headphones or fit in the ear i still prefer a wing tip in the ear for like actual workout stuff so like beats fit pro beats studio buds those types of things stay in my ear better so worth considering that stuff but as far as like everyday buds you put them in your ear every day you take meetings on them phone calls you walk around with them you just have them on all the time google assistants your super power yeah these are great uh these are the these are the ones i'm gonna put in my backpack and keep around with me everywhere i go well done google thanks for making these please push that eq feature i'm gonna be waiting for it thanks for watching catch you in the next one peace [Music],"Holy wow thank you. Thank you for just saying it. I’m going to watch this vid 3 times because I’m in a flight and you deserve the watch time for just saying, these are good, buy them, In the first two min. | marques i know youre probaly not gonna see thus but thank you soo much for making these videos. i really love them. right now im super sick snd keep throwing up but i steel feel happy watching some of your videos | Time for buds 2 pro review | These are the worst | ""nice"" 😂 | I just got the Pixel A series ear Buds and it's my first time using wireless earphones. Don't really have much to compare them too. | Damn you can tell he loves him so much. He even says I loved that man. | Got them yesterday for $99 Canadian. I like them. The volume could be better. It depends on the item you are listening to. Your video is fine .. but some music it would be nice if it was louder. | Clearly reviewers are either fanboys or too scared to give an honest review in fear of losing any free stuff.

The case is terrible. It's a known issue with the right bud constantly disconnecting if you can get it to stay connected, the fit is terrible, the sound is shocking no bass high end is tinny and mids are flat and shallow. | Just got them for 99 CAD, i am so happy"
d7y9z7pjCRM,The Hyundai IONIQ 5: I Get It Now!,"If the future of cars is electric, we need more EVs like this The new Auto Focus Channel! https://youtu.be/OKjyz7Jp4kA MKBHD ...",2022-08-25T21:49:16Z,3667679,110471,4532,[Music] i finally got to try an ionic 5. so i was gonna do this whole video on the state of evs electric cars and i was doing all this research and looking into it and the more i thought about it the more i realized i really only had one major point to make which is that if the future of cars is electric then we're eventually going to have to get some really good affordable electric cars like there's a lot of really good electric cars out there already and they're really tempting but they're all so expensive at least more expensive than their gas counterparts and i also do remember when i had that conversation with elon musk in the tesla factory a while ago and i asked him about like a potential 25 000 good mass production electric car if that was even possible and he said yes and that answer has like made headlines over and over again every few years since then but the truth is it's never been harder to make cars than right now and it's never been more expensive to make cars in right now obviously supply chain issues and it's hard to make a new electric car for all these companies but the point is yeah we're eventually going to have to get some good cheaper electric cars and this ionic 5 that i've been driving around for about two weeks has convinced me that we are right on the cusp of that so the ionic to me stay with me is kind of like the samsung zflip4 like it's one of the least expensive options in an expensive new category plus a flip phone in 2022 kind of has a little bit of a retro future vibe and so does this car i have started a new channel to talk about all my thoughts on cars i actually have quite a few of them so the first video is on the rivian r1t that i just took delivery of and we're actually already using it to shoot this video because that's what i got it for it beat the cyber truck to market by quite a bit either way you can go subscribe over there if you're interested i'm really excited about that channel i'm probably gonna shoot most of that stuff on whatever phone i'm testing at the time but the autofocus videos no need to fear will still be here on this main channel and i was so excited to test out the ionic 5. see at some point i just started seeing them around more and more like there's a lot of teslas on the road already so they kind of blend in at this point i also feel like i see a mustang mock e every other day but these ionics just started popping up and got my attention and i kept wondering like okay wow lots of people are buying them they must be pretty good right they're picking them over other options and now after driving the thing for like two weeks i get it i fully get it i mean this is a well-rounded all-wheel drive crossover with plenty of space a distinct but not super lame or flashy design an efficient 250 plus miles of range and a sub 40 000 starting price tag and it isn't really bad at anything so on the outside it has this design of like what people from the 80s thought a car of the future would look like now it's obviously a crossover with a lot of storage which is what people are into right now but it's very retro future and angular and i really like it and the coolest part for sure is the dot pixel theme all over the car the tail lights and the blinkers are pixels and the front of the car that's my favorite part the glossy black rectangle is maybe not my favorite but everything else around it especially the dot pattern led lights is so sick it's very unique on the road and looks electric without looking dorky i mean i can't really ask for much more than that and then i have these like four things that i keep in mind whenever i see a new electric car just as far as like pillars of reasonable electric cars which would be solid range uh fast charging zippy performance and extra storage so range is the easy one how far can it go on a charge right so the ionic 5 was giving me a really impressively accurate range estimate as i drove around which i really like it's more accurate than tesla's and so on a full 100 charge it would give me around 250 miles that's right around my comfortable baseline and it'll charge up to a ridiculous 350 kilowatts which would theoretically take it from 10 percent to 80 charge in 20 minutes now most of these chargers available to this car aren't that fast but that's another story for another day but then the zippy performance is the other easy part this is the dual motor all-wheel drive variant so it's a little more powerful than the single motor 300 mile version but with a little less range and it's easily as quick as any of its gas powered equivalents i think on paper it's like a five second zero to sixty which is already pretty good but it's not even about that it's the zero to thirty or the twenty to forty like just zipping around town or merging onto highways and with all that it's very responsive now the last pillar i say is extra storage because when you get rid of the gas engine obviously there's just a bunch of extra space and all the parts that come with it are gone and so every company has a different way of taking advantage of that extra space so rivien did a pickup truck with a gear tunnel and lots of other cars like tesla and ford have added a front trunk the ioniq does have a front trunk but it's so small that i don't really count it really they just extended the wheelbase and made a crossover suv with a ton of internal storage big big trunk lots of legroom and headroom in there and a ton of space between the seats and there's even this like movable armrest thing between the front seats honestly other than that this is a pretty average if not slightly subpar interior for a 45 000 car but if nothing else it is spacious so i say it checks that ev box so the ionic hits all those fundamentals which you know if we were missing one of those then i would sort of question like maybe i can't recommend this or i'd question why it's missing it but it has all that stuff so that means everything else is just extra you know stuff like software features autopilot type stuff creature comforts little quirks and features so i'll give you a few things that the ionic does that i really like and then some other things that i don't like so much so the ionic has paddle shifters which might sound kind of weird for a one gear electric car but they adjust between levels of regenerative braking so you can adjust on the fly with the paddles between coasting like a regular gas car all the way to one pedal driving where it breaks when you come off the accelerator it's not the first time i've seen that but i like it a lot that is dope it also has an hud up front with this top tier spec it has a really solid traffic aware cruise control that takes over on highway driving and makes stop and go traffic way easier and it supports both android auto and apple carplay which is convenient because aside from these capacitive buttons which really should have either been full on touchscreen or regular buttons i think the worst thing in this car is the maps and it's funny the software and navigating around is actually pretty responsive it's totally fine and the features are nice it shows you how much range you'll get in each driving mode plus how much extra you can get if you don't use the air conditioner but the second i pop into the maps which is theoretically the most important part of an electric car it's brutally slow and clunky and unintuitive so apple carplay and android auto are great you know in-car replacements for the ui but they aren't particularly good at charging stuff so they don't know as of right now if you're driving an electric car or not and so if you're planning a trip they don't know how many miles of battery you have when you arrive at the charger and how long you need to stop before you need to go again it's uh you kind of need to rely on it so again android auto apple carplay really good but for actually doing a road trip and navigating through chargers and planning that way you kind of need the in-car map to be good i might have to add that to my electric car fundamentals anyway i tweeted a few weeks ago there was this sick hyundai like track concept car and i was like yeah whoever's doing design for hyundai right now keep it up you are absolutely killing it and that's i think the last thing i want to talk about which i think is kind of underrated in this whole electric car revolution which is rolling out your first electric car for all these companies is basically an opportunity to rebrand to start over a little bit and create a fresh reputation like if you think about it hyundai might be the best example like what in the last three three four years what did you think about hyundai you know the tucson the santa fe you know in the u.s they're typically 20 to 30k pretty reasonable affordable cars but now all of a sudden this new car is 40 to 50k and is considered one of the more affordable impressive easy to recommend options in a new category so i guess what i'm trying to say is these these car companies can create a whole new reputation from scratch for this new audience especially of younger people who are going to grow up and eventually buy their first car that may just be an electric car so if your reputation was already good like a ford then maybe don't think too hard about it if you're coming out with an f-150 that's electric just name it the f-150 lightning but if you're looking for a change in reputation that i think that a lot of companies are then this is an opportunity for them just saying anyway i get it now i get the ionic 5 and i'm glad i got to test it from the eevee fundamentals to the distinct design that's not too weird not too quirky but pretty sweet i think it's great it's not cheap but it is one of the most affordable evs at this moment in time uh so yeah i get it and not only do i get it but this is the exact car i think we're gonna need to see a lot more of to sort of usher in our electric car future anyway go subscribe to the cars channel if you want i'll see you over there it's below the like button thanks for

yQThMUn_UmM,Android 13 Hands-On: Top 5 Features!,The 5 best features in the newest Android 13 Update! That shirt! http://shop.MKBHD.com The dbrand Something skin: ...,2022-08-16T20:03:28Z,4033337,157932,5611,[Music] all right let's talk Android 13 hey what's up MKBHD here so I just did my iOS 16 Hands-On couple weeks ago did my walkth through and demo and everything so as I was digging through Android 13 for a sort of similar demo two things struck me one the iOS videos always get just absolutely nuts views literally every single time and that's not just because the iPhone is already popular but iOS updates just get saturation so quickly there's a couple sources estimating iOS 15 was running on 90% of compatible iPhones well within a year of it going out so across the board most people who had bought an iPhone in the last four years knew that they're going to get this software now in Android land on the other hand as of a week ago the distribution chart looks a little something like this which shows that about 13 1 12% are on the latest version Android 12 a much larger 27% are on a 2 gen old version Android 11 and then another 22% are on Android 10 and then the fragmentation just continues back from there so this Android 13 stuff I'm about to go over a few people like pixel owners in the beginning will be the ones to get this but then it'll it'll much more slowly trickle out to other phones as they get updated month by month and that's sort of a general theme here but then number two in both camps these updates are more minor than ever obviously they're both very mature in iOS you could consider the new lock screen overhaul pretty major but other than that bunch of smaller stuff and then with Android we just had the big material U overhaul with Android 12 so with 13 they didn't really have to overhaul things again it's a lot of smaller tweaks and so that's what we're seeing but I still do think a lot of the small stuff adds up to quality of life improvements the best analogy if you look at the Easter eggs this is the Android 12 Easter egg from last year and this is the Android 13 Easter egg it's almost the same thing but you can tell it's a little different but hey here we are with the very latest and greatest from Google I have it on my pixel 6 Pro and so I've gone through all of the many many updates and gone through the liberty of picking my top five best Android 13 features so I'm going to start at number five which is the clipboard there are a bunch of really solid improvements to the clipboard for copying and pasting with an Android so first thing you're going to notice when you go to copy something the new box pops up in the lower left corner whether it's text or an address or URL or whatever you copy when you copy text the phone will now give you a preview with the option to tap on that box and then edit the text in the clipboard so whatever you modify in here will be saved in your clipboard so that you can paste it later and then if you copy an image it'll automatically take you straight into markup so you can write on it or crop it or save it whatever you want to do and then your phone will recognize sensitive information if it's stored in your clipboard and automatically clear it after some time I believe it's 1 hour so for example my package tracking app every time I open it right away it just looks at C is what's on my clipboard in case I just copied a tracking number from another app and it asks me if I want to paste it but if I just copied like a social security number or a password or something else random like that I don't want that in there so anytime any app might look into your clipboard it'll be empty because of this new Android little clipboard update and Google is also now working on an official built into Android universal copy and paste between phones and tablets so it'll just work across we already know a pixel tablet is coming it's still a few months away I guess it's sometime next year but looking forward to that they've done a bunch of stuff in the tablet World in this Android 13 update but that's one of them the clipboard will now work across both so then number four is Security in general lots of nice security and privacy improvements I think my favorite is that when you give photo access to apps now you can just choose a few photos to give it access to instead of your entire Library so that catches up to what iOS has been doing for a little bit and also Now notifications are all opt in so apps have to ask you for permission to send notifications instead of any being allowed by default there's also now an active app indicator at the bottom of the notification slider maybe that's uh less security and just more of being able to see what's running and closing out anything that you might not realize is killing your battery but yeah it's also just convenient so then number three is some nice audio enhancement stuff so Android 13 will now natively support spatial audio and Bluetooth LE for higher quality low energy and low lower latency audio all good stuff side note I am testing the pixel buds Pro right now as of today when I'm using them they do not support spatial audio but there also is a blog post that says that they're going to be adding it later this year so maybe a firmware update will eventually give me that but so far they are pretty impressive stay tuned for that review cuz that's coming up soon but then number two this is a really interesting one apparently it was one of the most requested features in Android for the last little bit and now they're adding it which is app specific language support so if if you're bilingual you speak more than one language but maybe you only use that second language in a certain app maybe you have a family group chat and what'sapp or you have a very specific use case where you just use one app in a different language Now Android will natively support that exact switch without you having to work around it so you go to settings system languages and input and then app languages app developers will have to opt in to do this so not every app shows up here right off the bat but I believe this should be a pretty quick like checkbox that they flip and then they'll be supported in multiple languages the whole system UI changes to be the new language just for that one app that's sweet I'm not even someone who will actually use that feature but I can understand how that would be very useful so that's pretty cool so then last but not least number one is Aesthetics so material U was the big overhaul for Android 12 that was the big visual change that they' made so now they're down to tweaking a lot of the things that they'd you know initially changed for Android 12 and I think a lot of these changes are good so in the the customization section the theme picker for your wallpapers is much more precise there's 16 different multicolor options and 16 different single color options now instead of the four of each we had before and there's a lot more granularity between them then there's the media player this one's nice the notification is bigger and it changes color based on the media that you're listening to so if it's music or a podcast it's got the album art going and then it also has a squiggly line when there's actually something playing I'm not going to say what that looks like but yeah if you tap the playback location there's a bigger volume slider and you can quickly switch to or add more sources like headphones or speakers or your car or whatever but that New Media Player is sweet and then there's even just some tiny tiny visual stuff like there's a slightly new lock screen clock there's a slightly new unlocking animation if you'll notice that uh the shortcut to get to settings has moved from the middle to the bottom of quick settings to be much more reachable I actually like it here and the gesture bar at the bottom is now slightly larger and thicker see told you it was minor there's a lot of little stuff but again it adds up to quality of life improvements there's also a ton of bug fixes and performance improvements and Android runtime improvements hopefully things are generally less buggy and more smooth uh there's a whole page of just dozens dozens of bug fixes that they've added I'll link it below if you want to read through those but ideally I mean so far should be running better on phones like the pixel 6 than Android 12 was I do also want to mention though I think there's one thing that got worse I think they lowkey made some of the haptic patterns worse I hope they think a little bit about those but generally that's pretty much it that's Android 13 for you let me know if you're uh hoping to get that update on whatever phone you're using and let me know what your favorite feature is in the comment section below either way that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys later peace [Music],"why has every update become more complex? 10 years ago my samsung galaxy victory smartphone

MEiq0oCUb_8,Dope Tech: The Most Extreme Gaming Monitor!,"Dope Tech is back! Transparent batteries, massive curved monitors and swiveling webcams Thanks Samsung for sponsoring a ...",2022-08-15T14:16:31Z,4780679,161301,4356,[Music] yo what's up mkbhd here welcome back to dope tech i love doing these the series where i find the dopest tech and then share it with you so we got a couple things with this one first one is these these are battery banks this is the shar geek storm 2 and storm 2 slim uh let's be honest most battery banks are basically the same thing right they're all kind of boring but i have gone on to basically replace all of my functional battery banks in my life with these because they're the same thing but cooler you know maybe transparent tech is having a moment here in 2022 because we've seen the nothing phone the nothing earbuds and some other transparent stuff logically why not try it with power banks too and it turns out it looks sick so basically all power banks inside they have got to have batteries they also have a logic board and some ports this one does a great job of being able to see straight inside i would say in a tasteful way but i also haven't flown with this yet and so i kind of wonder what the tsa would think about this design luckily it's got a little label that says airline safe on it that should do it but i think the best part is it's actually a really good power bank so all the ports are on one side here the small one the slim has one usb a and one usbc and it's 20 000 milliamp hours that's enough to fully charge a brand new macbook air and i say that because it also outputs enough power to do exactly that the usbc port here will output up to a hundred watts and the best part is there's this little screen here on the power bank that lights up when it's doing something it has all kinds of nerdy information about every single little thing that's going on in real time so your charging power wattage amperage temperature and everything it's actually sick so yeah as soon as i plug something in i know how much power it's giving or receiving i don't know if you remember that cable i showed that's in the what's in my bag video that also showed how much power was going through it on a tiny screen but this is kind of like that but with any cable you want so the bigger version has more ports and it's also bigger so it has more capacity this one is 25 600 milliamp hours that will charge a 14-inch macbook pro from zero to a hundred in an hour and a half so i guess what i'm trying to say is unless the airline's taken from me i'm gonna use these for everything now i really like them i use them currently we use it literally to power the mixed pre 3 that my my audio device is for recording videos they have this terrible design where you need a power bank instead of putting batteries on the back because it blocks the sd card slot anyway i'm loving them they're both 200. not cheap but hey this is dope tech okay so this thing is ridiculous so samsung reached out and they wanted to sponsor a look at their new odyssey arc gaming monitor i've seen some pretty crazy monitors in my time but nothing like this so this is a massive 55 inch corner to corner 165 hertz curved gaming monitor pretty sure it's the only monitor in the world with that exact spec and it has a one millisecond response time plus it's amd freesync premium pro certified so it's definitely built for gaming and in every way this thing is ridiculous it basically feels like putting a tv on your desk but way more powerful and it needs some pretty serious hardware like this huge foot wide metal stand and the mount that's attached to it to hold the whole thing above your desk so why would someone get something like this like what is this capable of well turns out pretty much everything so it plugs in via this box back here like some other samsung tvs and there's four total hdmi 2.1 ports on the box so you can give it a bunch of inputs and then there's this remote like it looks kind of like a skinny tv remote that comes with it and there's also this which is called the arc dial it's kind of crazy i've never seen anything like this before but basically instead of having to reach all the way around the back of this huge monitor you have the controls on this dial and it connects wirelessly via bluetooth and that's how you get to your settings and control this monitor so you can set it anywhere you want at your desk for your controls and both this and the remote have solar panels on them so you should actually pretty much never need to charge them which is super smart so this arc dial will let you control pretty much everything about this monitor but when you're just using it like a normal monitor not even gaming just for productivity and stuff like that it's still very impressive it is a huge monitor and at this resolution it can fit a ton of stuff on the screen any app or program that benefits from spreading things out will never look better than it does on this monitor also the whole thing has a matte anti-glare finish that cuts down on reflections or any lights that may be in your living space and you can put tons of things on the screen to your heart's content and i feel like because of the curve you know it's not as neck breaking as something this size would be if it was flat so just so you know this is called a 1000r curve monitor because the radius of the circle that this monitor would make if you extended it all the way around into a circle is 1000 millimeters so the smaller the number the more pronounced the curve and this one curves so much that the upper and lower corners really do stretch into your peripheral vision just gives you maximum immersion and then as you can imagine it's incredible for gaming so i've gamed on a lot of nice monitors in the past couple years and also tried gaming on tvs in the past this isn't quite like either one of those experiences because the size and the height and the sheer curve and the image quality it's just an amazing setup for pretty much any game that you throw at it also the speakers built in aren't bad either there's four speakers at each corner and two central woofers so just with the monitor's built-in speakers you're getting a dolby atmos setup and it can help with object tracking sound because the left and right channels are so far apart this is a quantum mini led display at 4k resolution so there's legitimately details in the darkest and brightest parts of scenes and games but also samsung says there is a multi-layer neural network for upscaling but just like playing a game full screen obviously it's incredible but let's say your neck does get tired right you're not really so used to turning your head as much or maybe you're just super used to playing a game on a smaller screen like a 24 inch or 27 inch screen right all right no problem so this arc dial lets you pop into a setting called flex move screen you hit that and then you can literally drag down the size of the monitor to whatever size you want it to be you want a 30 inch monitor you want a 27 you want a 24 22 whatever all these different sizes are available to you it kind of looks crazy tiny you can move it around maybe put it in the middle so you're not looking down all the time there's your smaller monitor it's convenient fun fact this graphic that's behind whatever your screen would be actually changes based on what's on your screen so it matches the colors if it's dark then it'll be dark if it's bright and colorful then it'll match the colors but probably the most extreme feature of them all this whole thing this gigantic panel rotates 90 degrees to create this towering 55-inch diagonal monstrosity that's literally curved over your head basically towering over you so seeing this monitor in portrait mode is wild and there are even a couple window management features to help you make the most of this ridiculous amount of vertical screen real estate here you can see it mimicking three 27-inch monitors stacked on top of each other each with something completely different going on the screen so productivity can be fun each of these windows is the size of an entire monitor and if you're feeling bold it's actually the world's best shorts or reels or tick-tock monitor where you can truly kick back and immerse yourself and waste unbelievable amounts of time there's actually also a feature called eclipse sync which has two lights on the back of the monitor that will change colors based on what's in the game to reflect off the wall for even further immersion but let's be honest most of the time your eyes are going to be all over this display all the time now this is dope tech so we know it's the craziest leading edge stuff but if you do want to actually get your hands on something like this it'll run 3 500 and if you want to justify it you could say it's kind of like having three or four monitors in one so yeah shout out to the odyssey arc for that that brings me to my third and final item here now as you can imagine the webcam situation with a huge monitor with any huge monitor can be pretty crazy but also webcams generally are pretty trash but then this insta360 link webcam started showing up on my feed actually a lot in the last couple days there's a bunch of sponsored videos this one clearly isn't sponsored by them but i did get my hands on it and i wanted to check it out and it turns out it is really cool and very impressive for certain groups of people so first of all if you're just looking for a quality upgrade a dedicated webcam will always give you that over a built-in so with this one you're getting a half inch sensor 4k 30fps video phase detect autofocus this is easily miles better than any normal built-in webcam into any computer it's kind of like the opel c1 but they're both like a step below using your literal iphone as your webcam with continuity camera but as you can tell just by looking at it it's this little rig here it's about more than just the camera quality it is all about the features so you can see it's got an entire gimbal built in like someone sawed it off the bottom of a drone and stuck it onto a webcam and the world of motion controlled video camera just opened up a world of possibilities so having a swiveling tilting articulating camera as a webcam means it can follow you around and track you around a room no matter where you go and it is a thousand percent faster and more responsive than like what we've seen when apple does the super ultra wide camera and then does center stage and crops in this just this is i feel like i can walk around the room and it'll follow me so this will clearly be pretty sick for streamers uh but i think underrated it would actually be even better probably for remote work and remote learning things like that um because continuing along the theme of this being the smartest webcam i've ever used it can obviously use the gimbal to point in any direction so it's a really solid desk view because as you can imagine it literally just tilts down and points more directly at your desk and then proceeds to use sort of extra processing to create a pseudo top-down view kind of like what apple did with continuity camera but then probably the most useful one there's these tracker stickers that come with the webcam all you have to do is put one on each corner of a whiteboard and then move the whiteboard somewhere into frame and then all you have to do is give it a peace sign and it'll go into whiteboard mode you can see the whiteboard over there behind me it's not even like in the normal frame of view of the webcam i'm just going to give it a peace sign it blinks it goes into whiteboard mode and it sort of locates the whiteboard takes a second you can see it going over my shoulder there that's the whiteboard and then it snaps in and now you're fully on the whiteboard well you miss some i'm teaching i'm instructing things on the whiteboard from across the room so easy like this is everything apple center stage ever it to be obviously they want you to be able to put your ipad down and walk around the kitchen and it follows you but yeah this will literally follow you and complete 360 degree around your laptop it's it's much better so yeah i'll give it another peace sign it'll realize it can go back to me snaps back to me and then uh yeah we're just using the webcam like normal again but it also has a feature which is when you stop using it so i'll stop recording and then you close the app and it goes to sleep after a while it just shuts down and faces straight down which is sort of a privacy feature which just means it won't be able to look up and at you it's nice that a webcam that can turn around doesn't when you're not using it it's a privacy feature so yeah i think that's gonna that's gonna easily qualify for the smartest webcam i've ever tried uh but it's pretty smart that a camera company is what insta360 is is making a webcam so that's that's why it's also fantastic quality and everything else that's around it works pretty well so yeah pretty sick that's why it's dope tech so that's it for this one a super cool clear battery bank an insane 55 inch super curved gaming monitor and the smartest webcam that i've ever tried i really enjoy doing dope tech videos and i'm glad we're bringing them back i'm kind of surprised we haven't done more we'll probably do another one soon in any case thanks for watching this one subscribe to see the next one when it comes out and i'll talk to you

ErMwWXQxHp0,Best Back to School Tech 2022!,Thanks to @BestBuy for sponsoring today's video! Check out the tech I showed off on my Best Buy storefront at ...,2022-08-08T15:00:13Z,2881103,120095,5224,[Music] this video is sponsored by best buy hey what's up bhd here so this is kind of funny all the years that i was in college i never actually made my own like best college tech or back to school tech video i graduated from college seven years ago and it makes me feel old saying that out loud but back then i was just watching everybody else's back-to-school tech videos and then trying to get my own stuff together but fun fact uh the school i went to the college i went to actually as part of tuition gave every undergrad student the same hp laptop which was kind of a nice perk it was a thick workstation everyone had the exact same one so as steven students we didn't really do back-to-school computers but we did do back to school everything else all the spicing up the workspace and the the dorm room and everything around that computer either way i might be out of school now but i finally get the chance to make my own back to school video so i want to do it now in 2022 when the options are better than ever so i got 10 things for you and this video is sponsored by best buy which just means that all the stuff i'm going to talk about is also available at bestbuy.com all the links are going to be down below in the description and you can also go to a best buy and actually try this stuff out in person too which is pretty dope so first of all a computer so i'm going to give you three options i'm going to have a windows option a mac and a budget option so now something i didn't tell you earlier at the school that i went to the uh all the engineering and business major students all had the same hp laptop but then all of the music tech and visual arts majors all got the same macbook pro so it was just different software depending on what you have to do i don't even know if this is still true or happening there but the point is if you're not going there and getting a laptop for free as part of your tuition uh you might want to get a new computer to match your new work so in the windows world i'm going dell xps now college is already expensive so it's a big extra expense to add a high-end computer on top but the way i think about it this is a computer i'm hoping to use for at least the next four to six years straight so it's an investment in the future for sure so the xps 13 is one of my favorite laptops it's world class easy to recommend here but i'm gonna go with the 15. this xps 15 if you can splurge is getting you an even bigger potentially 4k oled display higher end rtx gpu great keyboard great bigger speakers and this thing you can expect to handle some pretty demanding workloads not just games in between classes but potentially also getting some pretty serious coding rendering whatever you cut your teeth on at school getting all that done so this is a good one now in the mac world the m2 macbook air feels like the solid no brainer i consider the m1 macbook air because i did keep it around and it is cheaper but again i think new chip plus getting the new screen new design the ports magsafe and all that is well worth it plus getting the new model has you future-proofed and getting pretty excellent performance across the board the mac versus windows choice in college is mostly basically comes down to software not just games but a lot of times literally just whatever you're majoring in there's going to be certain softwares that just work with certain types of computers so that's important but i think yeah no matter which one you get you're getting a good one but i do have a third option uh it's more of a budget option and i'm also pretty jealous if you are studying something that can make this work but consider a chromebook so the galaxy chromebook 2 is my favorite chromebook right now of course it's just chrome os so you're doing everything in web apps note taking emailing collaborating etc but if that's you then this is a lightweight well-built chromebook that should have your back now no matter which machine you choose i have one mouse recommendation and that is the logitech mx master 3s so this thing is quietly released a few weeks ago which is fitting because really the biggest update over the mx master 3 is it's quieter it also has a higher max dpi honestly this is the most versatile complete easy to recommend mouse for me and it has been for years i've used an mx master for a long time at this point i even think you can game wirelessly with this thing so yeah easy easy ad there if you're looking for a mouse now if you happen to be taking the right classes and you're in the right note-taking situation that a stylus and a tablet actually works for you first of all i'm jealous but then second of all uh the ipad air and second gen apple pencil are excellent now there are a bunch of combos that will work for this too samsung's galaxy tabs and their styluses are really good and there are lots of great note apps on android as well but i'm going with the ipad air here and the second gen apple pencil that snaps right onto the side as the safe bet every time i review the ipad i always give the pencil a shot just for kicks obviously artists get a lot more use out of it but i also found that taking math related notes specifically when there's all kinds of formulas and structure to them trying to keep up on a computer with a keyboard just doesn't cut it for me so i always have to write this stuff down but having a virtual notebook that is pretty sick the newest air has the m1 chip there could be an m2 version soon by the time you see this i don't really know but i also don't think it matters too much because ios 16 is still ios 16. all right new smartphone for back to school yeah sure why not galaxy s22 or really anyone in that series but i think specifically the base galaxy s22 now that we're sort of in the middle of its cycle is starting to see those discounts i reviewed it back in january and it still holds up as one of the best all-around phones that's the thing about the phones that come out in january we tend to forget about them later in the year but s22 still has some of the best cameras the best displays excellent battery and really good software plus the dex features are super dope if that happens to work for your setup maybe you have a monitor already and you just plug that straight in that could be cool too so can't really go wrong with that as a new phone also my daily driver lately has been an s21 ultra which is a sort of interesting fact i don't know if maybe that's worth a separate video maybe leave a thumbs up if you want to see a breakdown of that but yeah s22 now i've got some desk accessories here that i also really like that i've found you know you're going off to college for the first time you've got your dorm desk set up you want to get some stuff going to customize it that's what this is about that's also desk accessories that's a tongue twister try saying desk access desk accessories desk accessories but this is the college dorm where i made videos for a whole year and shared with a roommate i think i did okay nice setup but these are easily best if you have a device like an s22 for example that wireless charges so this audi light desk lamp has a wireless charger at its base it's a fast wireless charger and it also happens to be a really nice little led lamp three brightness settings no flicker you could go that route or just go straight up multi-device wireless charger for the dorm bedside this one from belkin is a go-to pro tip if you have an apple watch and it's the series 7 or later make sure you look for a wireless charger that specifically supports the watch's new 15 faster wireless charging speed it does make a pretty big difference and then last but not least headphones so if you're going off to college and this is from experience if this is the first time you're going to be studying or doing homework in a noisy environment noise canceling headphones can be a complete game changer so that's why i'm putting sony's wh-1000xm4 on this list i consider putting the mark fives on here but i think as a deal the mark fours sound just about as good but they fold so they fit easier in a backpack they have almost all the same features and they're less expensive so the mark 4s are still awesome i highly recommend them maybe the only downside being that they're not waterproof but this is this is your new study hack but the only reason i bring up water resistance for my student athletes out there is you can't really work out and sweat a lot in these and trust that they're going to last a long time so you probably already have a go-to set of workout headphones but you know going off to school might as well upgrade so the beats studio buds have been great for me the shape the fit the features the sound pretty much everything about them they are also ipx4 water resistant of course and there's just been so many waves of me going back and forth between recommending and not recommending beats products over the years but these are definitely on the really good side the shape is so important they stay in my ears for everything short of like sprinting or jumping and landing hard on the ground but it's rare for my ears for something to fit this well so yeah go get you an upgraded pair of workout earbuds you won't regret it and that is it there you have it my first back to school set of recommendations ever let me know how i did but i couldn't wait to make this video so i was pretty pumped about it but that's ten things to send you back to school and hey shout out to everyone who graduated this summer best of luck over the next few years and may they be filled with tech and thanks again to best buy for sponsoring this video everything i talked about you can find at a best buy and of course all the links will be down below this video to check out as

4SHlY9AoXzc,OnePlus 10T Impressions: Somebody That You Used to Know,OnePlus 10T is looking more generic than ever. And that's by design. OnePlus 10 Pro: https://youtu.be/7IaYSxDp88s On fast ...,2022-08-03T15:30:32Z,2314278,83023,5757,[Music] hey what's up mkbhd here this is the new oneplus 10t and it's the most generic oneplus phone of all time so while i'm not reviewing this phone this is my first impressions i have had it for about a week and a half but i also was busy winning club ultimate frisbee world championship for the past eight days in the middle of ohio with the new york club team pony anyway typically the t phone for oneplus is just taking whatever their latest and greatest was and giving it a spec bump across the board to just make it a little bit faster in every way sort of like what the s used to be for the iphone but this isn't a direct sequel we have the oneplus 10 pro in january looks pretty similar but that was 8.99 when it launched now it's 7.99 so just keep this in the back your head as you're watching this this isn't a 10 t pro it's just the 10 t and so it launches at 6.49 so on one hand now we know okay this is a lower price we know to expect some things to be cut some shortcuts to be taken to get to this price here but on the other hand some of the shortcuts that they took are downright head scratchers to me so the oneplus 10 pro from january had the snapdragon 8 gen 1 chip and up to 12 gigs of ram so this 10 t has a new snapdragon 8 plus gen 1 and up to 16 gigs of ram great so there's a spec bump a reason to get this phone cool and they're nearly the same size but last year's phone had 120 hertz display curved pretty dramatically over the edges this 10t is flat it also has a thousand hertz touch sample rate and gets a little bit brighter it is also adaptive instead of ltpo and it's 1080 instead of 1440. this all makes complete sense i mean ltpo and especially 1440p are sort of reserved for the highest end of phones so at this price 1080p oled 120hz adaptive refresh rate it's good it's got the fingerprint reader under the display it's got the hole punch in the top middle no surprises here design wise though the 10 pro was a satin soft touch black that i really liked with a dark satin metal rails that was kind of sick actually the 10t here has a new black textured back called moonstone black it's got these little dashes or lines through it and then instead of dark rails it has sort of normal generic chrome ones for their new 360 antenna system and instead of a camera shelf it's more of a smoothed out camera slope up to the shelf which i actually kind of do like but i liked it first on an oppo phone that came out a while ago so now it feels even more like another oppo phone again adding to the list of reasons why it feels a bit more generic then you might also remember oneplus signed this big three year deal 100 plus million dollar deal with hasselblad for their cameras which would let them borrow maybe some color science or some image processing and the oneplus 10 pro was a part of that in january it had the hasselblad branding on the back and even a hasselblad themed camera app well less than two years later this oneplus 10t doesn't have any hasselblad stuff anywhere there's no hasselblad camera app there's no hasselblad branding on the back of the phone and as far as i can tell it doesn't appear to use any of that new color science or image processing either now is that because the cheaper phone isn't worthy of the new hasselblad sauce like it's not it's not expensive enough to get that or is it just because you stopped caring about it i don't really know i guess i feel like if you've already paid for it you should just put it in all your phones but it's not here and then you might have also noticed that this is the first one plus phone ever made that doesn't have the alert slider literally one of my favorite features of any oneplus phone that they've had for years the three-way volume slider that lets you quickly switch between sound on and vibration and silent it is now gone from the oneplus 10t and they gave their reason for it you know it takes up more space than you would think inside the phone the board has to come across and we saved that extra space and gave you a little more battery blah blah blah you can still do that stuff with software i actually believe you but like just think about identity for a second can you actually imagine the iphone dropping the mute switch because apple wants to save some space and prioritize something else inside the phone i literally can't picture an iphone not having a mute switch like sure you can always do it with software yes but that i would bet anyone a million dollars right now that the next five years of iphones will all have a mute switch because it's just such a part of the iphone's design so you know a new one plus phone coming out and not having an alert slider it might be kind of minor to some people who have never bought a oneplus phone before or never even followed or cared about the oneplus stuff but to people who have this is kind of sad that it's not here uh just more generic points for this phone the 10 pro had a standard camera an ultra wide and a telephoto plus an led flash with some text in the middle we talked about how that was kind of dumb text but it was there to no one's surprise that text is all gone and in true generic fashion they've moved to a sony imx 766 sensor for the primary which is the same one that was in the nothing phone and the zenfone 9 and the rog phone 6 and a bunch of others it also has a 12 megapixel ultrawide camera and a 2 megapixel macro camera more generic points now probably the biggest feature headlining this phone like the one that gets emphasized the most from oneplus when they tell me about this phone is the battery so it's a 4 800 milliamp hour dual cell battery which is slightly smaller than the 10 pros 5000 milliamp hours but it now charges with oppo's supervooc technology at a crazy fast a crazy fast 125 watts it actually comes with this brick in the box which says 160 watts on it but the phone peaks at 125 watts here in the us and that's good for 1 to 100 in literally 20 minutes it's insane like it really is truly incredibly convenient i did a whole video all about fast charging pretty recently but with this one i got it down to 20 doing some demos plugged it in for 30 seconds and it got up to 22 and then i let it go for another three minutes and it got to 32 just easy so i guess that does feel like oneplus even though it's opposed superview charging they've always emphasized fast charging here but they also didn't put wireless charging in this phone so you know you get the peace of mind of having fast charging but you lose the convenience of wireless charging even more generic points the funny thing is despite my disappointment i i bet this is a perfectly fine phone for a lot of people decent screen high-end chip lots of ram pretty smooth performance from my first impressions decent cameras and an oxygen os that's more like color os than ever before that's actually what a lot of people are looking for at 650 bucks and hey it's even getting four years of software updates and i guess that's the point which is this phone is more generic than ever before which to me or someone who's familiar with the oneplus story and the history of the brand and all that is pretty disappointing but that also means by definition that this phone appeals to more people than ever before so this goes right in line with what i talked about in my what happened to oneplus video if you haven't already watched it i'll make it the first link below like button because you should definitely watch that video but uh yeah i remember i tweeted a couple days ago when we first got some of the specs of this phone that it seems like a new oneplus phone without an alert slider feels like them just completely giving up on their identity and it was funny so many of the replies were like actually it feels like a couple years ago when carl pay left that's when they gave up on their identity and other people were like actually no the oneplus 7 pro was the last good phone they ever made then it went downhill some people were like the oneplus 3 was the last time they ever made a good phone and then every phone since then was just trash but at the end of the day this is just my first impression and the moral of this story for me is don't be a fan of the company be a fan of the product the individual product and if you look at this on the market today this phone is fine i'm sure it's fine everything about this phone it's all right nothing too crazy about it and that's what they're intending to do with the sort of remnants of what oneplus is there's a lot of other good phones out there for the price and i highly encourage checking them out again this sort of sweet spot of 600 dollars which is like a lot to spend on a phone but also sort of right in the middle now considering you have thousand dollar flagships there's a lot of competition there i just reviewed the zenfone 9 incredible phone for the price i really like it uh and so a lot of comparables but hey when you're familiar with oneplus this phone is just feeling more generic than ever before either way that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace [Music],Hey where that 1 mill at 🤣 | I'm sorry but I am only now watching this video and realised he said imagine if iphone didn't have a mute switch and he can guarantee the for the next 5 years apple will have their mute switch it didn't even last 3 years before they got rid of it 😂😂😅 | 4:30 didn’t age well | Mkbhd i need my 1 million dollars rn they removed mute switch from iphone for action button | mkbhd when the iphone stops having a mute switch but an action button instead | Just came back to this video to say that it didn't take Apple 5+ years to remove the mute switch | Apple removed the mute switch after watching the part where he said he’d bet a mil🌚 | 4:26 I want that milion dollars now | 4:38 yep.. the iPhone 15 dint have a mute switch.. GIMME A MIL BUCKS MARQES | 4:28 hey just a reminder that apple removed the mute switch after 2 years of you uploading this video to replace it with action button...... so where are my million dollars?😂
AxV0_1Y4zl0,Asus Zenfone 9: The New Compact King!,Most underrated phone of the year so far. Love this thing. MKBHD Merch: http://shop.MKBHD.com Tech I'm using right now: ...,2022-08-01T22:23:11Z,3874424,141316,7434,hey what's up mkbhd here so if you're one of those people who has ever thought wow seems like all the phones coming out these days look and feel the same well this one's for you because this is one of the most contrarian against the grain set of features i've seen in a new phone in a long time so this is the asus zenfone 9 and the more you look around this phone the more you see it's just not like very many other phones first of all flagship phones these days are getting bigger and bigger than ever we know this this phone is actually refreshingly compact it has slightly bigger bezels but those are around a 5.9 inch display so maybe not many but pretty close and that translates to so many little things just feeling smaller in the pocket smaller in the hand obviously reachability of the whole display is easier it's great and then you already know most flagships these days are working with glass they're usually pretty shiny and glossy backs this one is plastic but it is a sort of a nice textured uh softer touch plastic bag it's not quite the rough sandstone of the classic oneplus phones but it is somewhere in between it's got a little more grip which combined with the flat aluminum sides of this phone are quite nice to hold plus it has all these little design cues you know the little notch cut out around the metal of the power button the little bits of text on the back of the phone not full-on rog phone levels of text but it is something and the notch cut out around what is that oh yes a headphone jack yet another piece of this phone that you just don't see very often in many new phones out there plus just when's the last time you saw a red phone the only thing i don't like about this design might just be that the size of the camera bumps makes the whole thing rock when it's flat on a table but we'll get to those cameras in a second a lot of phones have been moving their fingerprint readers to underneath the display which fair they've gotten pretty good lately maybe haven't improved that much in the last year or two asus said you know what we're going to take this power button and we're going to double it as our fingerprint reader but not only that we're going to have it triple as a smart key so you can customize both a double press and a long press to start a quick action you can start google assistant with it or open literally whatever app you want and then not only that we're also going to have it quadruple has a reachability hack where you can swipe the button down to pull the notification shade down at any time anywhere from any screen just like samsung did back in the day with the galaxy s10e i think it was and asus has really gone the extra mile just to make sure you can reach everything on the phone with one hand they've also got a little edge tool to let you quickly launch apps with your thumb from the side what else do most normal flagship phones have these days i think you could argue a pretty heavily customized software experience is pretty common i'm happy to report though that asus is taking the opposite approach with a fairly lightweight just couple of additions on top of nearly stock android so zen ui which is what it's called just adds a couple things here and there and it's doing wonders for this phone first of all for performance i mean there's no real bloatware here things are pretty light this phone also has a 120 hertz display and combined with the top of the line snapdragon 8 plus gen 1 and 8 to 16 gigs of ram things have been very smooth pretty much all the time which is awesome and for usability they just find a couple places to tuck some extra features into the settings around the material u elements that are smart like little thoughtful additions here and there i like i like that they lifted the display animation speeds that are usually buried in developer settings and just put it right into the display settings they always on display you can customize a little bit to look differently and they put a bunch of stuff in the advanced section including mapping a double back tap to a custom action or a custom one-handed mode for even better reachability and actually one of my favorites you can super easily customize which camera modes show up at the bottom so you aren't always scrolling around looking for the option you want no matter which one it is so then battery life yo let me talk to you about the battery life on this phone so typically on a smaller phone especially a small flagship phone that's one of the weakest parts of the phone which makes perfect sense there's a lot going on in a small space so there's not a lot of room for much battery this zenfone 9 has a 4300 milliamp hour battery which is pretty big for the small size of this phone and when i put my sim card in it honestly i was expecting about the status quo you know i set the 120 hertz refresh rate because that's what i'm into and i got way way more than i was expecting this phone actually has seriously incredible battery life it sips power turns out this is actually a really good phone to put the snapdragon 8 plus gen 1 in because not only is it more powerful at the highest end but it's also more efficient than the previous chip so great standby time and a lot of quick bursty stuff has handled no problem but i was having like heavy days of using a lot of high brightness screen on time navigation playing some games just doing a bunch of stuff that typically drains phones and it just lasted for a long time i was having seven plus hour screen on time days and ending with 10 20 left really great battery on this phone and hey while we're at things that punch above their weight class the cameras back here the cameras are probably better than what you're expecting now the main sensor here is actually the same one that was in the nothing phone and the rog phone 6 both of which took like b to b plus quality photos at best and were a noticeable step behind the flagships in pretty much every way so same chip in here but two things are different one they put this entire sensor in this huge six axis hybrid gimbal stabilization setup and two we know a lot of what makes a good smartphone camera these days is software so the zenfone 9 takes photos that look very different from say the rog phone which actually asus also makes or the nothing phone basically if you've watched my blind smartphone camera test in the past this statement won't shock you but the zenfone 9 has the closest look of a pixel phone of any non-pixel camera so a typical zenfone 9 photo is very bold and contrasty and saturated so straight off the rip it's pretty nice if anything it can have the tendency to go over the top and really over process and over hdr things that looks kind of harsh and you can really see that in higher dynamic range situations but the extra stabilization does help not just for video but also for taking less noisy photos in the dark at least on the main camera it's still not freezing moving subjects very well because you need a fast shutter speed and a bigger sensor to do that reliably but out of all the phones with this sensor i think this one looks the best the ultra wide is also pretty consistent with color to match the main camera so shout out to asus for their software processing in the zenfone cameras over the years maybe pass some of that along to the uh rog phone team you know maybe have a meeting or two so i've said a lot of positive things about this phone so i'm just going to say one more which is i think the price is really good it starts at 6.99 which actually when i first started i put my sim card in this phone like two weeks ago didn't really know much about it and i hadn't been told the price yet and i would have guessed higher than that it kind of reminds me of when uh pixel 5 came out and it was the best pixel at the time but it was a snapdragon 7 series it was 90 hertz and we we're hoping for like a full flagship pixel this feels like a pixel 5 pro like two years later it's got the highest end chip it's got a nice screen an incredible battery life uh not a whole lot of downside i'm gonna say actually this phone at this price is my favorite release this year i am very impressed with it now it's not perfect and we already know no phone is perfect it's got a few key trade-offs and so i'm going to nitpick because that's what i have to do but here's what's wrong with this phone so battery life is incredible like i said but the max charging speed 30 watts that's decent but there is no wireless charging that's missing lots of people love reminding me that they don't really care about wireless charging but hey almost every other phone at this price is gonna at least have the option so that's something to note and then this display that i was telling you about it is definitely super responsive at 120 hertz with a 240hz touch sample rate but it is a slight step below the flagships visually and it maxes out at 800 nits when not showing hdr content which can get washed out in direct sunlight also the corner cutout for the selfie camera has this little ring around it that might be a little more distracting than some people might like also the speakers and small phones have never been great because physics and these aren't really an exception they're fine but they're semi-easily blocked and then probably the biggest thing i've noticed is this soft touch red color is very cool and i really like it but i am concerned about how this will wear you can see the edges and the corners of mine are already starting to fade and turn darker and the sunset red color is slightly less vibrant than it was when i first got the phone and this is only two weeks like i haven't really had the phone for that long so while i haven't seen a phone with quite this finish of plastic before i can't vouch for it aging well now just to get ahead of the comments that i can already see you typing yes most people just put a case on their phone already by default so it does actually come with this decidedly more plastic feeling case in the box but yeah i don't know i just i feel like a phone that has a soft touch plastic back shouldn't have to always have a case on it the way maybe a fragile glass one might so yeah that's something to know and then all the power button features i was just telling you about super first of all this is one of the fastest fingerprint readers in any phone you just graze it for a second and it unlocks super sensitive but then the pull down notification feature i was accidentally triggering all the time it kind of got annoying so i ended up turning it off because it was getting in the way kind of like i on the s10e i think i also disabled it so cool for a few days then i turned it off but yeah this power button this is something sustainability note this phone isn't particularly repairable but it does come in 100 fully recyclable packaging and it does come with 30 watt charging brick but yeah as far as downsides that's pretty much it i think i can confidently say this is the most well-rounded compact phone in the world if you can consider it compact i think there's a lot of really great things about this phone and i'm very happy to keep using it this is probably going to end up extremely underrated in the us because you don't really see zen phones in carrier stores so most people don't end up buying these but if you're looking around shopping for a great compact android phone around 700 bucks don't even think twice this is a great one to get yeah easy as that okay that's pretty much it thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace

DFgYGBtJLnI,The iPad&#39;s Odd New Feature,Stage Manager in iPadOS 16 is fascinating to me. I have a theory... iPad Pro M1: https://geni.us/YOzu MKBHD Merch: http://shop.,2022-07-28T00:33:15Z,2815161,98029,6271,hey what's up mkbhd here and i've been using ipad os 16 on the new ipad pro for a little while and one of the biggest new features on it is called stage manager and i have a theory about it now a lot of ipad power users like myself have been excited for this feature to drop because we've been waiting for a sort of mac like real multitasking experience on the ipad so stage manager comes along and it is technically a multitasking ui but the more i use it the more i can sort of crystallize this theory in my head which is that apple doesn't seem to want the ipad to do anything the same way the mac does it now this goes back a long way you know when the ipad first came out it was more or less a gigantic iphone but it's slowly gotten more and more powerful in front of our eyes until this point we have a thousand dollar ipad pro with a 13 inch mini led display and a whole m1 chip inside the exact same chip that's in some of the most popular computers that they make but the ipad software has stayed remarkably consistent which is a nice way of saying it hasn't advanced quite at the same rate as this hardware so a lot of people have big ipad dreams of wanting this to be their only computer and have it be just as capable as any other computer but it hasn't been and that's been the biggest knock on the ipad for a while now sure we've gotten some stuff we have widgets on the home screen since ipad os 15 we have our split screen apps we have our slide over apps and all this stuff but again you'll notice that they specifically don't do anything here the same way they would on a mac they always want to find a new ipad way of doing it like when the ipad first got a trackpad and mouse support that was a big deal we were waiting for that but instead of a normal mouse we got this unique circle pointer thing that floats between possible touch targets very much the ipad way you might remember when i asked craig federighi why there wasn't a dedicated weather app and calculator app on the ipad this was his answer the ipad still does not have a default weather and calculator app and they want to know why you know there's some things that we we have not done because we to do it we would want to do something really distinctly great in that space and uh i think it's obviously easy to create a calculator app uh but creating one that feels like wow this is this is this is the greatest ipad calculator app that it felt like i think we we we want to do it when we can do it really really well and and we we honestly have just uh uh haven't gotten around to doing it great so uh that that day that day may come but uh and you know whether it be easy enough to scale up our additional our existing weather app but we feel like what would a great weather app for ipad be like let's let's do that before we do it i suppose that makes perfect sense but listening back to that two years later it sounds even more like we haven't really gotten around to doing it the ipad way yet even the headline on apple's website for ipad os 16 incredibly capable unmistakably ipad so when it comes to multitasking this is like the last big hurdle on the ipad's way to finally feeling like it's a real computer we all know what we expect multitasking to look like on a normal computer like a mac but in accordance with my theory and this i can't prove it but this is just my theory is apple doesn't ever want the ipad's multitasking to look or feel or work like it does on a mac they've got to find a ipad way of doing this now to throw a wrench in my theory this is also coming to the mac in the latest version but the latest feature here is called stage manager and uh it's not bad it's just an inherently new different way of doing multitasking on a touch screen or on a monitor like this and it's just another thing you're gonna have to learn to get the most out of this thing so basically what it looks like is you enable it in the settings then toggle it on in control center once you do you can open up an app to bring it on stage and then off to the left here you have your recent apps that are off offstage so you're on stage app it's a window it isn't quite full screen and so you can drag the corner and move it around and you can see that there's a bunch of slightly different predetermined window sizes it's not perfectly fluid it's just a bunch of sizes that apple picked and then you can bring other apps from off stage to be on stage at the same time so now this is officially the first time you can have more than one windowed app open at the same time on the ipad and again you can mess with the sizes you can group apps together and then you can bring them on or off stage at will so it is still definitely very much not the same thing as multiple windows open on a computer with the little buttons in the corner and then fully fluid window sizes and all the stuff but it is running simultaneous things at once and it is multitasking and it is the ipad way you can have up to four apps on a stage at once which can look kind of ridiculous and probably even more so on a smaller ipad but then you can move a whole pile of apps off stage by switching to something else and then bring all four of them back on at once it's just technically a lot happening simultaneously and then if you connect the ipad to an external display finally finally the ipad doesn't just mirror anymore but it actually treats it like a second display to extend onto and lets you have up to four more piles to the side on stage manager so you can really multitask to your heart's content on a large display where it doesn't feel as crowded and you can have a ton of processes happening at once it's impressive but it's not perfect there are already some pretty well documented downsides the first one just being that it's not very widely available literally only m1 ipads will support this so resource intensive that it uses memory swaps so that's not very many ipads right now but more importantly i still think this is a little bit complicated and not the most intuitive thing in the world now this isn't the end of the world for a ipad power user who's just like yeah bring on the new ui and stuff i'll learn it no problem but are you also going to remember that if you open an app that's already in another group it will open that whole group so you have to manually drag the app out into another group if you want to work in a different set of apps or what about that you can't make it automatically open apps maximize so you have to drag them to cover the whole display or hit the dots at the top and hit zoom every time to bring them to full screen or what about the fact that there are iphone size apps still like whatever the hell instagram is still doing hence they don't resize at all and they seem to mess with the whole multitasking thing since you can't seem to choose where it goes either and also the fact that this feels like about the fifth different way to multitask on an ipad that's buried behind some slightly obscure gestures and is off by default there are still the three dots at the top of every window if stage manager isn't on and that's how you still get into split screen apps which again have a set number of predetermined sizes and that's also how you get into slide over apps which are the tall skinny apps that you get to by sliding over from the side which by the way have an entire multitasking carousel of their own you also can't drag windows straight from an ipad to another display so you got to click the three dots then move to display and then do that same thing again if you want to move them back and the ipad does not work with a secondary display while its own screen is off so like a laptop a computer might have clamshell mode where you close it but it's still plugged into a monitor you can use with the ipad if this screen is off so is everything it's connected to plus don't forget about the keyboard shortcuts if you have the magic keyboard that goes along with the ipad a lot of them are the same as they are on a mac but there are some that are slightly different it's a lot so i feel like you probably get what i'm saying the the state of the ipad is fascinating apple's given us an amazing piece of hardware and it's very powerful and they've added a bunch of features to try to take advantage of it but now in their effort to do it the ipad way every single time they're walking a tightrope between two sides where one side is amazing intuitive powerful on the other side is a little too complicated a little bit unintuitive and hard to remember they're just right down the middle for people who use an ipad how do you use your ipad what do you do specifically on the ipad are you a one full screen app at a time person you just keep it propped up in a folio touch screen all the time let me know in the comments section below how you use the ipad and until the next one i will continue to be confused about the what is a computer question thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace,"I use for skool, 2 tabs at a time | I just got a samsung ad on this 💀 | And I really wish apple would add stage manager to all iPads | iPad is in perpetual reiteration.

With having M series mac i am gonna buy a simple ipad just having a touch portable screen for the times you want something bigger on a trip or weekends or reading books ... ipad pro will never replace desktop computability if it continues this way.

UsD87v8F914,Google Pixel 6A Review: Can You Feel It?,Pixel 6A is Google's new budget option with one looming flaw. Giving the Pixel a second chance: https://youtu.be/MiTG1ride7s ...,2022-07-21T17:01:03Z,4208500,122056,6548,[Music] hey what's up mkbhd here and this is google's new budget phone the pixel 6a we knew this was coming i've had my hands on this phone for a little over a week now and i have my thoughts sort of summarized into one major thought which is there's a lot of competition in this budget phone space now and this phone isn't the obvious hands-down winner that it might have once been but this year more than ever i think the primary reason for that comes down to the display and i'll explain what i mean so what we're getting with this google budget phone is and this may sound familiar a new chip the exact same one that's in the flagship models the same software experience as the flagships but just with some cheaper hardware surrounding it you know kind of like the iphone se but google's version and so the price here is 449 dollars it really looks just like any other of the pixel 6 phones i mean that's the one thing i like about the whole lineup they're unmistakably pixel you've got the two-tone colors the camera bar across the middle is recognizable as a pixel from a mile away the only difference here is well it's a slightly new color this one is a sage green but also the camera bump isn't as tall so it's a bit slimmer it doesn't protrude out of the phone as much so i don't really use the ledge as a grip as much anymore as i used to on the other phones everything else though on the outside is pretty much the same it's got the aluminum rails same power and volume buttons on the right side with a notch between them the speakers and the slightly off center usb c port at the bottom it's all back on the inside though this phone is ip67 not ip68 and there is no wireless charging that to me was kind of a bummer i know we're probably saving a couple dollars here but this phone still has a glass back and i don't know if you've used wireless charging before then it's kind of worth noting that this one won't have it and then also the pixel 5a had a headphone jack this pixel 6a does not have a headphone jack so again if you use that then that's another thing to note but really around the front here is where the pixel 6a actually most reflects its price so we've got a 6.1 inch flat 1080p oled display at 60 hertz with a top center hole punch and an in-display fingerprint reader visually it's an okay display it's decently sharp with good color and it gets bright enough to support hdr and not totally suck outdoors but also it has some pretty serious off-axis rainbowing and the auto brightness is a little finicky and the fingerprint reader is definitely slow it's on the slow side just like it was on the pixel 6 and 6 pro now this may be forgivable stuff in a budget phone we've seen stuff like that around this price but what really takes it a tear down for me is the 60 hertz specifically because this one feels slow actually let me be more specific so this is a 60hz display there's lots of other 60hz displays in phones out there having a tensor chip which is a relatively high-end chip inside should mean that the phone still feels fast and it still opens apps pretty fast and that's still mostly true here but for whatever reason the responsiveness and the actual smoothness of the display this is not smooth so i think this is absolutely going to be one of those things that you either feel and notice right away or you just never notice i think there's a lot of people who are going to be looking to get a pixel 6a that are coming from an older phone coming from a budget phone coming from other 60 hertz phones and this will probably feel right in line but even amongst these 60 hertz phones i feel like this is one of the choppiest ones and now i've also recently come from a world of 120 hertz and 165hz flagship phones and gaming phones and that's not the normal place a 6a buyer will come from but the second you experience 120hz on a phone you are way more likely to notice the dropped frames in animations all the time even at 60hz literally just scrolling around pulling down the notification shade opening and closing apps normal stuff is just constantly slightly choppy now the funny thing is it's hard for me to show you this stuff on camera this is a 30 fps video and these things are happening somewhere between 30 and 60 fps but yeah this is one of those things where i bet if you get to see a 6a in a store or try it out then you'll feel what i'm talking about but it really is a feel thing and this is purely coming from my decade of phone testing experience this one feels choppy now depending on who you are even all of this might be acceptable knowing still that things are technically launching quickly and you're not lagging out and you're actually launching apps at normal speed but i'm combining all this with my knowledge of what i've just seen happen with the last year of pixels which is they haven't aged particularly gracefully so i've seen what happened to six and the six pro and i worry about how this fun will age considering how it feels now is guaranteed three years of software updates but what does this phone look like in three years now the good thing is everything else about the pixel here is exactly what you'd expect the same software experience as the big brothers with material u google's widgets and dynamic colors and stock apps like the calculator and settings and camera et cetera google's smartest features are all here like assistant call screening is awesome live translate and the sorcery that is basically instant speech to text everywhere in this phone thanks to the tensor chip they're all so good the haptics are also pretty good which is great to see in a budget phone along with the stereo speakers here really the only variables that could have come up as a surprise potentially would be battery or cameras so pixel 6a's battery is about 4 400 milliamp hours and it turned out to be fine there were some concerns because oh it's a tensor chip it's a higher end chip uses more power maybe in a smaller phone that's bad but turns out 60 hertz kind of balances that out so i had pretty good battery life i was just mildly annoyed by not having wireless charging but then there's the cameras so with the camera unlike the previous pixels this does not share the same cameras as the more expensive brothers the 6 and the 6 pro instead it has a downgraded 12 megapixel camera setup for both the standard and the ultra wide which might look disappointing on paper but this is the old sony imx 363 sensor which some of you nerds will already recognize is the same exact sensor that was in the pixel 5 and the same that was in the pixel 4 and the pixel 3 and the pixel 2 in other words this is an older smaller low resolution sensor but it is also absolutely a tried-and-true great smartphone camera because of google's computational photography chops so i really appreciated that even with the lower number you know with the tensor chip processing things happening really fast the shots that come out of this camera are crisp contrasty and confident just like they were with the older pixels the colors are on point too not too much over processing happening and there is not too much fringing at the edges either with close-up subjects and the dynamic range and how it handles highlights is a plus so i mean it's easy to see why they stuck with this for so long and the fact is this is still easily a top two budget smartphone camera easy it also has the ultra wide that the iphone se doesn't have and it takes decent looking 4k videos up to 60fps these cameras are like pizza sure they're not super new and groundbreaking there's nothing that would impress you about them on paper but they get the job done in a design that you can dress up like a ninja turtle if you get the right dbrand skins you know the ones linked in the description the conversation around the pixel 6a is probably the most interesting when you consider the competitors just the other phones that you could get for 450 and there's some other really good ones so to make it easy i think you should get the pixel 6a if you value the google software experience those features and or the camera way over everything else but if that's not you you could get a samsung galaxy a53 for a hundred bucks less and that's going to have 120hz display that has expandable storage or you could get a nothing phone which i just reviewed which has all those quirky lights features on the back but that's also got a much bigger much much smoother 120hz display and all their features you could even get an iphone se if you wanted to which yes is gonna be a 60 hertz single camera setup with a smaller battery but that's also a flagship chipset that's also wireless charging and that's also let's be real it's an iphone which is enough of a feature for some people and then there's some nord phones and some pocophones and some moto g's all with their own merits so yeah pixel 6a turns out is really all about the google software experience and the camera for the price that's where it excels but yeah if you're shopping around keep your eyes open because there's a bunch of good stuff and while good phones aren't getting cheap cheap phones are still very much getting good there you have it that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace [Music],"Absolute garbage ! | Problem with my network connectivity 💀poor💔 | Keycap set at 3:57? | 7:00 nah what are you

HeMIZC2rkMo,M2 MacBook Air Review: More Than a Refresh!,2022 MacBook Air M2: Impressively thin. Deceivingly expensive Buy Apple Air M2 MacBook Pro on Amazon at ...,2022-07-18T23:10:57Z,7438244,180621,6543,"[Music] all right what's up MKBHD here so tick tock that's what just happened to the MacBook Air not Tik Tok not the short form video website but two years ago we had a thin wedge-shaped Intel powered MacBook Air super popular laptop but that was also the beginning of the Apple silicon transition and that transition to designing their own silicon would mean they could unlock levels of optimization and streamlining that were never before possible when using an off the shelf chip from Intel so first they replace the Intel chip with an M1 chip in the wedge shaped MacBook Air pick now they've redesigned the Entire Computer around Apple silicon with M2 Co so theoretically this is more than just a refresh this is our first look at what's possible with apple in a thin and light form factor now that they finally design the silicon and everything around it and it's also deceivingly expensive but we'll get to that in a second so with Apple's most popular Mac I I fully expect a level of if it ain't broke don't fix it but to their credit they have changed and up updated mostly everything about this design and for the better the wedge shape used to taper to appear and feel thinner at the edges but now the whole thing is flat it's 11 mm all the way across which is actually thinner overall and I really like it this way this is one of those shapes that you just feel like you can pick up and take everywhere truly Ultra portable theyve thinned out the bezels around the new display which let them bump it up a bit to 13.6 in diagonally there's a notch in the top middle which has become a part of Apple's design language at this point but that quickly Fades away to invisible when you're actually using the laptop and it's housing a new 1080p webcam that looks fine I mean for sure better than the old one also the display is way better it has a higher 500 nit Max brightness and a lower minimum brightness for working in dim environments which I actually found really useful when publishing the nothing phone review at 5:00 in the morning here they also added mag safe plus a color matching braided cable which is a nice touch by the way they do include midnight colored stickers with the midnight colored laptop that's another nice touch but the mag safe charger also just means you freed up another USB type-c port and you also get that fast charging at up to 67 Watts which is nice because the battery again makes this a very long lasting laptop I'll still say the M2 MacBook Pro which is thicker is still going to be an overall battery champ but I mean the 15 hours of claimed web browsing translated for me to an entire workday of use with 20 plus% left it was awesome and if I had several light days is in a row with it I didn't even really think about charging it's great it's not perfect though I do still wish that they'd put USB type-c on both sides but as of right now it's two USB type-c Thunderbolt 3 on the left headphone jack on the right and so it only supports One external Monitor and if you do have an external monitor it'll probably have to be to the left and then when I first got hands on with this thing I was very curious about the speakers cuz as you can see they are pretty much invisible unless you know where to look but they are right up in the hinge of this laptop so I was curious if they'd be any good and I guess I shouldn't be surprised but turns out they sound really good they sound great not as much uh base and and thump as the bigger laptops like the MacBook Pros but still very very loud and more than enough for media consumption that type of thing music watching videos all that sort of stuff the one thing that turns out to be a downer here as much as I wanted to love it is uh this new color so the M2 MacBook Air now comes in silver and space gray like before then there's a new Starlight color which is a very faded gold and then this which is midnight Midnight is a very very dark blue and it absolutely changes how much blue it shows based on the environment you're in like if if the light hits it just right it can look like a blue laptop but in some environments it just looks like a matte black laptop which I think is sick but we were right in the first impressions this one is an absolute fingerprint magnet the instant you start using it and it's impossible to keep clean but then on top of that there are some durability concerns the normal wear and tear on the trackpad area seems fine and I've only had this for a week so I can't really test a longtime use but what we saw on the review unit that I had a couple weeks ago or the first impressions unit was around those ports the USBC port and mag safe ports if you miss plugging it in enough times you're going to scratch the paint and it'll be most noticeable on this dark laptop because it has silver underneath so I guess there's three solutions one uh don't get this color two if you do get this color maybe protected with a case or a debrand skin that's my personal preference there's lots of great debrand skins to make the the back of the laptop especially not look so ridiculous or three um take really really good care of it but overall though the new design I like it a lot it is remarkably thin it's not the thinnest and lightest laptop in the world but it's one of those like I could carry it everywhere type things I love using it every day it makes me kind of jealous because I in my normal workflow regularly do video editing on a laptop now so I carry around this huge 16-in laptop but yeah if I didn't have to do that I would love to carry this around so it's fantastic but speaking of workflow and horsepower we've now also seen already what the new M2 Chip inside this thing is truly capable of because we also took a look at the M2 MacBook Pro and we love it we love the CPU Improvement the GPU Improvement is even more substantial and the New higher-end Media engine coming down to M2 is awesome for video workflows especially in Apple's optimized apps it it's just better than m one across the board but now the most popular thing that everyone's been wondering that the most common question I got when I asked on Twitter Instagram I asked you guys what you want to know about this laptop is what's the difference in performance between the M2 Chip in a fan cooled system like the M2 MacBook Pro and in the fanless system that is the MacBook Air because in the short bursty stuff it keeps up with the MacBook Pro just fine they are very similar in performance with short repetitive quick stuff up to a couple minutes but at some point with a sustained workload this laptop is going to get so hot without a fan that it has to throttle to not overheat and this one with a fan will keep going at its normal performance where is that point and so I tried it with some benchmarks I've done it with some real world applications and it turns out that that point is somewhere around 5 minutes seems pretty short but when you think about it that's a lot of sustained load so that's not photo editing that's not web browsing or even like coding or or short bursty like Benchmark stuff a two-minute Benchmark won't show that difference here I'm talking about like video editing or long renders when you have background rendering on for 5 10 15 minutes in a row gaming even things that light up all of the cores all at once for several minutes in a row sustained and that is where the MacBook Air really gets tested I noticed it actually heats up quite a bit right in the middle so if your laptop's on your bare legs on your lap you're going to feel that but yeah that's where you hit the difference between the M2 MacBook Pro and the M2 MacBook Air but this is also kind of hilarious and impressive to me because we can't forget what this machine actually is which is it's a MacBook Air it's the Baseline it's the entry level of their laptop line up so the fact that we're considering if it can handle maybe four streams of 4K video editing at once or like big long renders or projects over a certain size is uh kind of amazing like I saw Brian Tong shout out to him and his videos he did a giant 45 minute 20 video track 20 audio track 4K export in Premiere to really see the difference between the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro by the way the difference was like 10 minutes so thank you for going through that for us Brian uh but yeah that's incredible because that's clearly not what this machine is really for it's for the everyday use of uh 30 Chrome tabs or 15 apps open at once but not really rendering or doing any sustained it's just like a bunch of normal stuff going on so basically the one thing going against this MacBook Air for me is the price okay so this laptop starts at $1.99 it's $1,200 uh which is already $200 more than the M1 MacBook Air is which stays in the lineup by the way it was a pretty good laptop when it came out still is that's 1,000 so this is 1,200 but the Baseline version also has the same SSD issue that the Baseline line M2 MacBook Pro had meaning the 256 gig version which uses a single SSD module instead of two smaller ones is significantly slower than the rest of the lineup literally half the speed and that's not insignificant remember the base version also has just 8 gigs of memory right and the M2 system on a chip means that shared memory is for the entire system so if you're doing enough you can actually fill up that memory pretty quickly which is when it starts to swap over and use the SSD and when that happens things actually start to feel slower on this base model so it costs another 200 bucks to upgrade it to 512 gigs that's the version I've been testing and that's what it should have started at in the first place now you're sitting at 1,400 bucks and 1400 bucks is not the same like super easy magical like th000 price point like we had with the last generation that's a lot more so here's how I think about this if you are someone who's actually considering buying the new Macbook Air I would just consider this a $1,500 laptop any less if you don't want to spend that much and you probably should be looking at the M1 MacBook Air that's still $11,000 still on the lineup still a great laptop but if you're looking higher up for certain reasons just know that the 14-inch MacBook Pro is just sitting right there waiting for you at $2,000 obviously this is very strategic by Apple and the way they've priced all of this is well thought out I guess you could say but the point is if you're planning to do a lot more of that creative stuff higher end workflows sustained loads uh the 14-inch MacBook Pro is a way better laptop like if I want to spec up this MacBook Air up to a way where I think it'll be very comfortable for a couple of years doing this creative stuff so you're going to add the 10 core GPU you're going to go up to two terab of storage you're going to Max it out let's say 24 gigs of memory which is the new Max for the M2 that's already over $2,000 and that'll be a really really nice MacBook Air and a lot of people who get it are going to love it but the 14-inch MacBook Pro runs circles around this laptop at the same price and it has a way nicer screen for that creative stuff it has ports for that creative stuff and it has an SD card slot which is what most of that creative stuff is going to need if you're doing that so I would suggest considering it so it's a little bit deceivingly pricey but the sweet spot for this MacBook Air is right around $1,500 and I think if that's the one you're considering that's the one you should go with there's going to be lots of people around that spec that I think you're going to really love it but other than that that's been my review of the fingerprin laptop we've ever seen aside from all the other matte black laptops anyway that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace","Best computer I’ve ever owned | I have to say, I really DOUBT that Marques still edits his own videos!!! | Nice  🇧🇩 | I do not understand the criticism of the midnight color. I have used it for weeks, I never feel it gets too smudgy to look bad. It's been really smooth and nice experience for me | Taper? | MacBook is a laptop made by Apple Inc. | I bought one month ago, I never had a MacBook before and now I am in love with how it looks, sounds and works | Don’t buy this computer if u wanna play any high end games, it runs at super low frames and sucks up ubsurd amounts of battery, I played war thunder on it for not even 30 mins, it dropped like 60 percent battery since its overheats like mad and doesn’t have a fan | That intro it sticks my mind I watched it multiple times ❤ | Is 706 a good price for these ?"
Jb88eui8SqQ,Nothing Phone (1) Review: Seeing Through the Hype!,Nothing. Everything. Something. £399 Get something from dbrand at https://dbrand.com/something MKBHD Merch: http://shop.,2022-07-15T09:02:28Z,6486763,199623,7439,in today's video nothing no i'm just kidding i swear there will be no more nothing puns for the entire rest of this video but in all seriousness today i get to do something i don't get to do very often which is review a new phone from a new company so this is the nothing phone one [Music] so on one hand this is a new phone from a new phone company but on the other hand you pretty quickly realize there's a lot of stuff here that we've seen before it's a company from carl pay former chief of oneplus running the hype playbook we've seen before of slowly revealing more and more info about a phone to drum up interest but what's new and interesting about this phone is what they've chosen as their differentiating feature so like i said in the impressions video if you're a new company coming along you have to give people a reason to choose it over the boring established ones that most people buy and so oneplus in the past would sort of lean on exceptional specs for a low price that was the thing that you could count on from a oneplus phone to stand out with nothing its design now i have a lot of thoughts and feelings about this design after using it for the past week there's both a dark and a light version of the nothing phone as you can see they both have flat aluminum sides all the way around the strategically placed antenna lines power button on the right volume on the left and then the back is the signature transparent gorilla glass with a design underneath it it is a pretty simple design but it is just nuanced and complex enough to appreciate it it has some depth you know it has indicators for certain pieces inside the phone like the wireless charging coil it has exposed screws it has written text on the back and most importantly it has the 900 plus leds organized in these diffused strips all around the back of the phone with the unique functionality that i'll get to in a second but overall with all of this together i think it's safe to say i've never seen a phone that looks quite like this before so as far as standing out from the pack with a unique design well mission accomplished but at the same time if you squint it does kinda look like an iphone still you know with the flat sides and the dual camera placement it has the shape of an iphone matter of fact this well this is an iphone with the brand's new something skin applied to it uh and short of lighting up the leds it basically accomplishes 90 of the same look from the different shading of the white color to the red recording light to the faithful indicator of where the wireless charger is supposed to be in whatever phone you skin all the way to the text on the corner that's just a very well considered easter egg i guess that's why they're a channel sponsor well done guys i'll link it below but the lights are what's really unique here as you can see the the glyph interface so not only do they look quite unique but they also serve a purpose they actually have a function to them at least they're supposed to so there's one light up around the cameras one at the top right corner one big one all the way around the wireless charging coil in the middle then an exclamation point at the bottom so for getting a phone call the lights all just light up and sync with whatever ringtone you have sweet the exclamation mark at the bottom will also light up to indicate your charge status and then it can show you again with a convenient little bump i definitely like that a lot and then it'll also light up when you talk to google assistant so if you say hey hot word what's the weather tomorrow you can see it lights up with a little feedback as you're talking then it reads you your answer out loud it's basically the defining feature of this phone in the dark or the light i actually think it looks better in the dark now that i've seen it but it's it's huge for this phone they also made a transparent case to be able to see it all the time now here's the thing all of these require you to have your phone out on your desk and face down which is cool but for me personally i typically have my phone in my pocket or even if i don't i'll have it on my desk but it'll be face up and even if it is on my desk and face up i also typically have it on silent so now that i'm using this phone i'm like oh i got to make a conscious effort to make sure i remember to put my phone face down more often just don't put it down on some some grit or some sand or anything and scratch the screen but it's the nothing phone like that's the whole point i gotta use it but even then i still find myself just flipping over the phone to check my notifications because i don't get that many calls and most of the time it's just a single blinking light at the bottom and i don't know what that means like i wish there was more granularity in what the settings could let me choose the led lights to do like i remember back in the day phones used to have rgb notification lights so i knew that a yellow notification light meant i have a new tweetdeck notification or a new blue one is a new email or a new green one as a new text message with this one it's all white leds so it would be cool if in the settings i could set a certain dot pattern to mean a notification from a certain app like that basically seems like the whole point of these lights best case scenario it can communicate with you without you having to pick it up but as of right now really your only options are to change the brightness and then to turn certain light features on or off i don't know based on the light flashing what type of notification i have what app it's from who's trying to contact me nothing i kind of assumed i would be able to do that and i wouldn't put it past them to enable that with some sort of software update but like i always say buy a phone for what it is now not what it's promised to be so yeah as of right now that's not real now there were some other questions about the lights some people were wondering if they took a lot of battery power nope they don't if you leave them literally on all the time for an hour straight they'll take maybe two to three percent of your battery so it's almost nothing and then the other thing was people were wondering about maybe some slight discoloration between the leds because as it turns out getting a bunch of different small cheap white leds to all be the exact same color temperature is actually pretty difficult now i have noticed that the top left light around my camera is slightly more green than the rest of mine but not enough to bother me or make any difference in the way i use it and the lights do actually get bright enough to use as a fill light that's one of the features and so in in really dark places really with a very close-up subject i can actually say that it is better to use than a normal flash but anyway now that you know about the aesthetic i can actually talk to you about using the actual phone and i think the good place to start with that would be the price and the price is starting at 399 great british pounds so that's the baseline price for this phone and it behaves exactly as you'd expect from a mid-range android phone in 2022. and when i say that i mean that as a compliment there are some really good phones in this price range where it's kind of hard to go wrong with the top options here the pixel 6as the galaxy a53s of the world and the nothing phone fits right in alongside those so it's really good it has a snapdragon 778g plus and it runs android very close to stock i would keep in mind the base price has just 128 gigs of storage and that model only comes in black but the version i'm testing which has 256 gigs of storage and 12 gigs of ram is 499 pounds but it has performed very well big time shout out to this display not only is it a pretty big flat 6.55 inch 1080p oled with pretty good brightness up to 1200 nits and not only does it have an under display fingerprint reader that doesn't suck and a corner hole punch with a selfie camera and not only does it have perfectly even bezels all the way around which is a pretty notably more expensive thing to achieve since we've got to use a flexible oled display but it also has a high refresh rate now it's not ltpo but it will dynamically bump between 120 hertz and 60 hertz depending on what you're doing and it has a 240hz touch sample rate so it is very responsive and smooth especially in just regular day-to-day stuff it can drop some frames when you're doing some more heavy stuff some gaming when there's just a lot more going on and that's understandable this isn't you know a super high end power hungry chip so there's going to be some trade-offs but it definitely helps that this software nothing os is mostly very close to stock android with just a few of their light touches on top lots of those touches are aesthetic and animations like they have their own fonts with this dot matrix style this nice extra custom animation when you pull open a folder on the home screen or pull down the quick settings and they have a couple extra home screen widgets they've tossed in and to me it looks like the only stock app that they've touched that they've skimmed are the camera and this voice recorder app which also has the dot matrix theme going on and they say it's gonna also be able to add this tesla car control feature which kind of lit my eyes up like oh that's what i would be able to use but right now it's in the experimental features section and even though i'm signed into the normal tesla app every time i try it it just keeps saying no cars found in your account so it doesn't work yet but apparently that's supposed to let you put some vehicle controls up in those quick settings like a door unlock or flashing the lights or something when they get that working but you know for now don't count on it i think basically i'm just happy there's no bloatware like it's just a very clean reasonable refined android experience and i think part of that is that it's not arriving on us carriers so you might have seen the headlines this phone's not destined for the us at least not right now but i also am having no problem using it on att doesn't get 5g but i've had no problems with getting 4g everywhere but it basically feels like a tweaked pixel which is a compliment i like it and then the rest of the phone across the board is uh pretty middle of the road pretty mid-range like i said it's not really flexing with the specs so these are some pretty modest ones across the board here there's a 4 500 milliamp hour battery inside which i was comfortably getting all day battery life with so that was nice it was a solid five to six hours of screen on time which for my use is a b plus and the charging speeds were yeah pretty modest 15 watts wireless charging and 33 watts wire charging which will get you half battery in half an hour it's not bad the haptics are solid definitely not bad but not notably amazing or anything i like them but the speakers are pretty forgettable technically they're a stereo pair with that earpiece up top but the earpiece is not doing much work and blocking the bottom speaker pretty much mutes the phone and it's only ip53 water resistant which means no dunking or splashing or wiping down the phone like you might be able to with an ip68 phone it's just one of the short places they save some money and the cameras typically this is the thing where you separate the mid tier from the flagship pretty quickly and i don't know if it's just because i just finished testing one of the absolute best smartphone cameras in the world but the nothing phones cameras were particularly average so there's a pair of 50 megapixel cameras on the back here with the primary having ois and at f 1.8 and with 114 degree ultra wide i think some people might go into this with high hopes based on the hype but they'll pretty quickly adjust because again this is a 400 phone okay so if i give it good light and good enough conditions i can get some decent shots nothing to write home about but acceptable photos which is good but as soon as you have anything less than a ton of light the photos very rapidly deteriorate mostly just adding a bunch of noise and the shutter speed going way up getting way slower so you can pretty much forget about taking pictures of moving objects in anything other than direct sunlight for context though just so you know the main sensor is the sony imx 766 which we just saw in the rog phone 6 i reviewed and it's also in phones like the oneplus nord 2t so set your expectations right and you won't be that disappointed but if you're hoping for some type of flagship killer camera this is definitely not it but hey on the sustainability note the nothing phone is made from 100 recycled aluminum these rails and also an impressive 50 plus percent of the plastics inside are made from bio-based and recycled sources also the box that came in is very thin and small which of course is too small to include a charging brick but it is fully recyclable paper and cardboard so i can appreciate that basically i'm overall happy to report that the nothing phone one doesn't feel like cheap corner cutting as much as that does feel like they set out to make a phone that hits a certain price point and then separate it from the pack by being a good user experience but also having a unique cool interesting aesthetic i think that's really smart so i think the bigger picture now is okay they're they're working on an ecosystem around this thing this new nothing company they started with the earbuds which were not the most amazing sound or performance in the world but had a very solid user experience and a very distinctive design and then they moved on to a phone which didn't have the most amazing performance or specs in the world but had a really solid user experience and a really distinctive design so what's next is it going to be a tablet a smart speaker i don't know it could be anything but whatever it is i think we can safely expect it to not be super focused on performance and specs but to just have a solid user experience and a distinctive design that's what they're going to lean into that's smart and i like it so even if it might not be for me someone who's pixel peeping and is particularly concerned about performance on the highest end i do like that we're still getting cool looking stuff that i just gotta say that more cool looking stuff please in the world of not as cool looking stuff it was nice it's dope either way that's been it there is nothing left to talk about catch you guys the next one peace [Music],"the iphone 16 design tho | What best app to get all your goggle photos on please | That light, the glyph thing needs to have a warning for possible seizures. Might look ""cool"" but not for those with photo sensitive epilepsy. | Wowsers! I'm very happy and impressed with this phone, it's like iphone from performance to camera is very satisfying. It's like you brought iphone with android OS and that's make this phone great! Very very very happy costumer, just brought this a month ago and still performing it's best no complain this is what exactly im looking for. Get yours now before its too late, also I just updated its os and it's so smooth to use very like it 👏👏👏 | This is a very polite and respectful review of one of the first products from Nothing

Kudos to you Marques 😃😁 | Kinda looks like the new iPhone 16 design | I've noticed that every company that but the selfie camera in the corner eventually puts it in the center-top of their phones | Would you buy nothing phone or Google pixel 6a/6 | Can't wait for you to review the Solana Phone | That shit creazy"
WfVF-Ec4naQ,iOS 16 Hands-On: Top 5 New Features!,"iOS 16, coming to an iPhone (8 or later) near you MKBHD Merch: http://shop.MKBHD.com Wallpapers: ...",2022-07-11T17:20:43Z,10352422,320014,9954,so the newest version of iOS was revealed by Apple about a month ago which means sometime in the next few months your iPhone's going to change for the better luckily as long as you have an iPhone 8 or later this is iOS 16. [Music] so I've had the beta for iOS 16 on this iPhone for about a month played around with it a lot it's not stable enough to make your main just yet just warning you but there's a lot of good stuff here some of which Apple did talk about on stage some of which they didn't either way this is the five best features in iOS 16. so number five the ability to edit and unsend messages so I realize I've only been asking to do this on Twitter but apparently people have wanted this for iMessage too so now you can long press the message you send and for up to 15 minutes after you first send something you can edit and then type what you actually meant to send and it'll revise to whoever you sent it to or if you're just so disgusted with what you originally sent you can actually unsend a message completely which is pretty sweet if you do either of these things the other person will see that it was edited but won't see the edit history and if you undo send it just leaves an alert in place for both people by the way just as a heads up if you go to try this feature with someone who isn't on on iOS 16 yet it won't work so they won't see the edit on their end or the undo on their end so they'll still see the crazy terrible message you initially sent uh you've been warned but that brings us to number four which is live objects now I think I gotta just sort of rewind just a little bit so you can understand or at least fully appreciate how amazing this is so you remember live text right live text lets you open any picture with text in it and it immediately recognizes that text and lets you interact with it lets you copy paste it somewhere Etc iOS 16 also adds live text in videos so if you pause a video on a frame with text somewhere in it you can lift that text from inside the video that way but the cherry on top is now in a photo with a subject and a background you can long press and literally lift any object out of a photo to copy and paste into whatever you want messages for example so it erases the background does all the masking for you and does a surprise amazingly good job for a literal one second background delete you can do this with seemingly any photo too it's not just like portrait mode photos shot on the iPhone it can be shot on any camera as a matter of fact any picture it just seems to need to have a reasonable subject versus background and the iPhone will just figure it out I am very impressed I'll be making all kinds of stickers for our Discord now so then number three for me is the little things just all the little things added up together this is one of those things where like iOS still looks and feels like iOS it's not that dramatic of an overhaul but when you add together all these small things it does feel like a pretty nice refresh and I I like pretty much all the things I changed I like that the weather app finally shows you individual daytime forecasts now it's crazy that it took them buying dark sky to finally Implement all this but now for one day you can see how the temperature will move and fluctuate throughout the day or when it will rain Etc love it I like the new video watching UI if you choose to watch a video in Safari now clean simple I like that face ID Works in landscape now it's a small touch but finally thank you I like that the home screen says search at the bottom where you can pull up a slightly refreshed Spotlight search UI pops up from the bottom now and I use Spotlight all the time so I notice this right away and I like that the things you order with the Apple card will start showing up in the wallet app it's self so if you keep track of everything there then rip to some package tracking apps and I know a lot of people that will like the iPhone finally has a haptic keyboard is one of those things that Android has had for so many years a decade at this point probably since the beginning but it's funny because it's one of those things that immediately lets me feel when a phone has a good haptic engine or not because first thing you do is type in a Wi-Fi password and you can feel the haptic keyboard and it's either a soft mushy haptics or really tight and clicky the good ones I leave it on the bad ones I'll turn it off so the iPhone literally has the best vibration motor on any phone so it's about damn time the keyboard gets the haptic feedback and it's very good it's off by default but you can easily hop into settings and turn it on so there's always a bunch of little things with software updates that sort of add up to a bigger change and I kind of like all these they're really good but now it's time for the bigger things so number two is continuity camera this one might be my personal favorite but it's the one I got the biggest announcement reaction on stage and it was the biggest shocker so it's super cool so basically over the years our smartphone cameras have gotten better and better but webcams in laptops not so much I mean it was only the M1 MacBooks in 2020 where Apple finally updated to a 1080p webcam but it still looks worse than a normal phone camera so Apple had this brilliant idea why don't we use the good cameras that we make which are the iPhone cameras as your webcam genius so you've got to have IOS 16 and the latest version of Mac OS Ventura to do it but once you've got all that going continuity camera wirelessly turns your iPhone into your Macs webcam so doing that not only looks infinitely better but also gives you access to all the other cool things that your iPhone's camera can do like portrait mode Studio light and Center Stage if you want it's pretty sick but easily the coolest part of this is called desk view so by using your phone's Ultra wide camera when it's mounted on top of your laptop or your monitor you can get your standard webcam View and this top down view of whatever's on your desk in front of you so in this case it's basically showing what's right in front of your keyboard where your hands are at anything that's pretty flat to the ground it seems like black magic but it works pretty well that's a lot of software processing going on to take the edge of the ultra wide frame and flip it upside down and turn it into this perfect top-down view but I can see this being crazy useful in so many circumstances as long as whatever object you're working with is pretty flat so that is dope and that brings us to number one which is the new lock screen this is the biggest visual most obvious change to iOS it's got the most new stuff here and it's just all the customization of the clock and the wallpaper and all the stuff going on so let's just jump right in so first things first the lock screen looks different right away new clock font matching colors some widgets so to start customizing your lock screen you just hold it down and then hit the customize button and then just tap what you want to start to customize so you can mess with the font and the color of course to get the contrast right so things are readable and then up above the clock and below the clock you have slots to add widgets you can see I already have a few here and it's kind of like adding them to your home screen you just pick the one you want to add tap it or click to drag it in and the widgets below the clock are very much just like watch complications they're these little square glanceable pieces of information that you can't really interact much with but when you click them they open the app that they're associated with and the ones above the clock are mainly just a text format so they make a lot of sense for maybe calendar events or weather things like that so you can already play around endlessly with just that combination of things you can mess with the clock the weather the widgets whatever else you want to put in there but then what's nice is you can save your layout what you've made and then go to create a new one so now you can save multiple different lock screens that you've customized and set up and just like watch faces on the Apple watch you can just hold it down and switch between any of these ones you've made at any time but now here's an extra wrench to throw into this whole equation if you don't add any bottom widgets so if you just have your clock and maybe a top widget there's a new feature where the clock will Nestle itself between the foreground and the background of your wallpaper and this was not just for like portrait mode photos or photos from the iPhone this is any photo so Apple's using a little bit more of their AI their impressive object recognition from that live objects feature earlier and it's able to with pretty impressive consistency give me some pretty cool cutouts it's really too bad it doesn't work once you add widgets under the time at least in this beta so you have to choose between a cool clock cut out and lots of widgets on your home screen but I think this feature is pretty sweet when it works and I am also a fan of this little animation you're seeing where when you unlock it fades in the foreground just before it fades in the background from black it's a nice touch now to take this even further you can associate any lock screen that you make with a focus mode so if you have a focus mode like for work for example you could already do a certain home screen for work now you can have a certain lock screen for work then you can have a home and lock screen for going to sleep going to the gym going home whatever all that stuff just ties and switches automatically and then also now that your lock screen is so much prettier the notifications roll in and they don't cover your Masterpiece anymore they roll in from the bottom so I really like that change it's good for reachability on phones of all screen sizes but also just seems to make chronological sense the way they've been rolling in and they keep rolling in from the bottom without interrupting your precious lock screen you can choose to display notifications as a stack a list or account in the past they'd always been a list that's what we're used to but I like them as a stack now it's more Compact and another cool feature Apple added is called live activities this is basically an app that will update its notification live with new information instead of sending you new notifications over and over again so something like when your Uber is getting closer and closer to you before it picks you up or maybe live sports scores just update to scoreboard I really like the new music live activity it's much smaller than the huge widget was before and you can still script through songs it's great and also the new live timer notifications pretty sweet just having that little animation to count down the seconds just a good amount of Polish here on the lock screen and I think that's really the highlight of iOS 16 is just people we're going to be out here customizing their lock screens doing crazy stuff with the way they that's the thing that you interact with the most on your phone how many times do you think maybe a hundred times a day you unlock your phone and look at the wallpaper and your lock screen it's a big deal so that's pretty much it for iOS 16 let me know what your favorite feature is in the comments below and I'll talk to you guys in the next one peace thank you,"Here after Netflix stopped supporting iOS 16

Xiaomi 12S Ultra,Xiaomi 12S Ultra has a truly incredible camera... sometimes 1-inch Sensors aren't actually 1 inch: https://youtu.be/-njHjebtIg4 ...,2022-07-08T00:57:43Z,3391896,122152,4534,[Music] okay so this is the xiaomi 12s ultra it's a smartphone sure but i think we can all tell it's all about the camera i mean look at this thing almost half the back of the phone is this massive camera module the first 20 pages of their website for this thing is all camera camera camera stuff before it talks about anything else they even have this video on their site of it morphing from a camera into this phone and it has the world's largest smartphone camera sensor inside can you imagine being the person at a party where everyone's got their phones they're like hey we want to take a group picture does anybody have a good smartphone camera and you just yeah that's i got it i guess what i'm trying to say is this phone better have a great camera [Music] so there's been quite a bit of hype around this brand new xiaomi 12s ultra recently so i had to give it a shot the headline that caught my eye about it is that it's rocking the world's largest smartphone camera with a one inch sensor but a couple funny things about that first one inch sensors aren't actually one inch they're a little smaller than that i actually did a video where i talked about that i'll break that down down in the description i'll have a link below the like button you can check it out but second it's not the first smartphone with a one inch sensor matter of fact there's been a couple before but it is the first one with sony's new imx 989 sensor which is the first one built for a smartphone camera rather than repurposing a one-inch sensor to go into a smartphone uh so it technically beats samsung to the punch who we know they're working on their iso cell camera that's going to be a one inch sensor probably coming to the galaxy s 23 ultra sometime next year so xiaomi beat them to the punch and as a matter of fact that's kind of the whole point of this phone is to one-up samsung's ultra phone in as many ways as possible and to slap the same exact name on it so you know they they can do it better that's the statement they're making so when i got my hands on this phone that's what i wanted to find out does it actually beat the king of the hill galaxy s22 ultra at its own game and most importantly is it actually worth it to have the world's largest smartphone camera by the way it's this one not this one in the middle that's the ultra wide and it's not this bottom one here that's the 5x telephoto that one that one is the world's largest smartphone sensor so i've taken quite a few photos and videos over the past few days testing this phone's camera in both normal conditions and crazy more and more extreme conditions at its limits and it turns out yeah this camera is phenomenally capable and is really really good very often so the 50 megapixel main camera kicks out great detail and sharpness bending down to 12 and a half megapixels and has a knack for reeling in exposure even in harsh conditions taking photos into the sun and with high dynamic range and all that but what i really noticed is two main things that were s tier that made good photos really really good on this phone and that's the shutter speed and the auto focus are consistently really fast because that huge sensor lets in so much light here so for taking pictures of moving objects like kids and vehicles you know pets sprinting around a studio with endless energy all that stuff it's great and that's awesome it freezes the action and nails focus very reliably and that is super confidence inspiring in a camera it also handled low light very well which shouldn't surprise me given the light gathering ability of a huge sensor but i did decide to do a little head-to-head against the phone it's trying to one-up so bad galaxy s22 ultra so i did a blind side by side on twitter i should have done a poll but just based on reading the replies a lot of you guys really did actually prefer the 12s ultra shot here despite it being more saturated mostly because it reeled in the bloom from the street light better thanks to better lens coatings etc and it still kept all the details on the rest of the exposure and had very low noise you might have noticed the leica branding up in the corner on the back of the phone they did actually have some help from leica on the optics and the coating over the glass to reduce things like fringing and chromatic aberration and it works great but also the color science so when you first fire it up the phone asks you if you want to shoot with like a authentic look or the leica vibrant look basically you can think of them as the same thing as photographic styles on the iphone the authentic look is a little less saturated while the vibrant kicks out a more instantly shareable traditional look but neither of them are particularly great to my eye now that i've shot with both so yeah the typical photo from the 12s ultra is a clean and sharp shot with shallow depth of field for close-up subjects pretty punchy and saturated usually and with a lot of dynamic range but here is my hot take on this camera though while it isn't perfect it has the highest ceiling of any camera i have ever seen in a smartphone so it doesn't always hit but when it does it is amazing i have two shots i want to show you that specifically just make me feel very strongly about this so the first one i was up on the roof of this building there's some plants up there it's windy up on the roof and so i'm taking a picture of these plants and they're moving quickly in and out of the frame i'm just sort of like pointing and shooting and boom the photo i get back is this tack sharp shot with incredibly shallow depth of field and this immense dynamic range the movement is completely frozen in time like the plants aren't even moving i kind of couldn't believe it just seeing how fast the stuff was moving around in and out of the frame it's a shock that autofocus even worked but it locked on it kept it in focus and it nailed it and it did it again and again and over and over again and then the other one is uh i was at practice the other day way out on an island somewhere i put my cleats on i was just about to put my phone back in my bag but i took a photo of the ground and just like my cleats on the ground before i got up boom and with this one this isn't even a particularly difficult shooting condition right it's not much moving it's just a still subject of my feet but optically this might be the most impressive photo i have ever seen come out of a smartphone camera keep in mind there is no portrait mode here this is normal depth of field my cleats are tack sharp there's a clear shallow depth of field and you can see the slight roll-off of the blur getting stronger and stronger the further you go back in the frame and the exposure and the contrast and the color of the entire shot are all so nice so you know it's just a random off-center snap of my feet but jesus from a phone i kind of love this photo so i've said a lot of good things about this camera but i also said it wasn't perfect so it's a flagship i'm gonna pixel peep and i'm gonna go through those things too it does have some of the more classic weaknesses of a big sensor smartphone like this so the huge sensor makes for a nice natural depth of field which we know is awesome it's amazing for those mid-range shots like two to four feet away but when you get too close it definitely definitely starts to fringe like any other smartphone with a huge sensor so you can get close up to a subject and there's real blur but often part of the subject is in focus and then some of it isn't and the blur is pretty ugly when this happens now they try to combat this like a lot of others do by auto switching to macro mode which comes from the ultra wide camera unfortunately the ultrawide camera has a dramatically different look and color science to it it just looks so different overall and in my opinion it looks worse it solves the fringing problem but yeah it looks worse and then speaking of color science it is dramatically inconsistent between the lenses you can easily see if you just quickly switch between them like go from 4.9 x to 5.2 x there's a pretty big difference in color in exposure in contrast in everything and the same thing happens in the ultrawide this is a pretty common thing with smartphones but it's particularly bad here and then the video footage the videos are typically pretty good you can shoot up to 8k 24fps from any of the lenses or 4k 30 which looks pretty solid when it hits focus especially with that rock solid image stabilization but it has this weird bug and it took me a minute to figure out what was going on because i shot a ton of videos and i was trying to understand here so stay with me right so i go up to the roof again i'm taking videos of the skyline and i see a plane and i'm going to go i'm going to i'm going to test this feature where i can switch between all three lenses while zooming through video cool that you can do that right so i pointed out the plane and i start taking this video and what i think i'm doing and what i see in the viewfinder is i zoom all the way in on the plane and then i track it across the sky perfectly keeping it in the center of the viewfinder so imagine my surprise when this is the clip that comes out of the shot it starts by zooming in on the plane but then uh it looks like like i fell asleep while recording or something like it totally leaves the frame and so i literally just got the shot and then went and watched it back and i saw that it wasn't what i thought i had i was trying to figure this out turns out what i believe is happening is as you're smoothly zooming in and out switching between the three lenses while recording the viewfinder is just smoothly zooming in on the primary sensor and so when it showed me that i was keeping the camera keeping the plane in the middle of the frame what it was actually doing was switching to the telephoto in the recording so you can actually see while watching the footage the moment that it switches to the telephoto camera which has a slightly different angle to it so at the max zoom that really adds up quite a bit so what i'm seeing on the screen is not what i'm actually recording this is something that i think they can fix pretty easily with software by just adjusting where the zoom happens but it's just an odd i don't know it's a quirk if you happen to be doing a lot of super zoomed in creepy videos of stuff far away then you should know that this one might you need to you need to calibrate or adjust for it but anyway there's so much more i could go into with this camera from the optical lens emulation from a couple old lenses to all the various modes there's a super moon mode and a multi-video angle mode a whole bunch of other stuff but i think the summary with this gigantic camera on this smartphone is the hits really hit it's hit or miss but the hits hit hard it is a fascinating optical experience shooting with this phone the rest of the phone by the way is very much ultra like again they're taking aim directly at samsung here so i'm talking snapdragon 8 plus gen 1 chip with 12 gigs of ram which is now a few months ahead of samsung making that leap it has a 6.7 inch 1440p 120 hertz oled display ltpo which is 522 pixels per inch with a max brightness of 1500 nits it's a world-class display aside from the curved sides and corners which i'm starting to hate there's also a 4860 milliamp hour battery which isn't the biggest but with 67 watt fast charging 50 watt wireless charging and 10 watt reverse wireless charging all better than samsung's flagship the speakers are excellent and dolby atmos certified and with plenty of eq settings to match there's a new x-axis haptic motor which is great and it's all wrapped in a build combining matte black metal and faux leather that's ip68 water resistant and looks like a minion just gonna be honest looks like a minion you will most likely never see this phone in real life if you live in the united states or north america but in the regions that xiaomi is selling it in it goes for about 900 which again is one upping or better than what samsung selling their ultra for so as far as their mission i'd say mission accomplished the me 12s ultra xiaomi mi 12s ultra is a really impressive phone the hits hit so hard i love this thing anyway let me know what you think that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace,"thank god they fixed all these issiues with the 13 ultra | The anti-creep zoom should be left as it is. | lmaoo it looks like a flat camera | I'm late to this party.  I tracked down this review by Marques because I enjoy his reviews and I recently bought a used Xiaomi 12s Ultra.   I enjoy photography, and my wife's from Greece.   In a recent trip to the Greek island of Naxos, I caught some better shots with my cheap Samsung A20 phone than my Leica camera simply because I always had the phone with me unlike the camera.    There's a certain magic when a camera and a lens is capable of taking the type of photo like Marques' shoe shot.   Marques' comment on  his beautiful shoe photo is perfect -  ""but Jesus, from a phone?"" | Lol Watching this video now and MKBHD mentions that S23 ultra to have 1 inch sensor which was their upcoming offering by Samsung. And guess what s25 ultra won't have it and most probably s26 ultra too won't have it. Since samsung has gone really lazy in past few years. It's sad that even Apple launched 50mp ultrawide earlier than Samsung which Samsung will bring in s25 ultra which would be the only change in camera. Very slow progress from Samsung! That's why I'll move to xiaomi | 1"" Inch is 2,54cm long and a 1"" Sensor is not that big,and is very bad in low light. | I'd be very interested in seeing you review the Xiaomi 14 ultra, will you be reviewing it? I'm thinking of moving from the pixel 7. Imagine quality from the main shooter is mainly what I'm interested in. Would it be a big step up for me? | Hi Marques, will you review the Xiaomi 14? | Marques make about new one, 14 , thanks I really like your contents. | 1inch sensor looks too small in mobile 😂 it is joke or what 😅"
dKq_xfCz3Jk,ROG Phone 6 Pro Review: Daily Driver Material!,"The gaming phones are refining themselves into bona fide daily supercars. And it should, for €1299 MKBHD Merch: http://shop.",2022-07-05T12:30:45Z,2728347,108772,4652,"[Music] all right what's up MKBHD here so this is the RG phone 6 Pro I just want to start off just by reading you the specs of this phone that I'm holding in my hand right here okay so it has a 6.8 in 165 HZ AMOLED display it's got a second OLED screen on the back too uh Snapdragon 8 plus gen one chip which has cores running at 3.2 GHz 18 18 GB of RAM 6,000 mAh battery with 65 W fast charging dual front-facing stereo speakers triple cameras including a 50 megapixel main camera and uh two USBC ports and a headphone [Music] jack thanks for watching now this phone's specs are ridiculous and they're ridiculous because it's a gaming phone and with a lot of these gaming phones in the past few years you could really say they were focused on one true goal to just be as great for gaming as possible but with the latest Generations you can kind of tell they actually have two goals now to be incredible with gaming and to also be really great to live with as a daily driver luckily a lot of what makes a phone great for gaming also makes it great for using in everything else but there are still definitely some challenges as you'll see in a second it's kind of like how sports cars back in the day notoriously used to be you know super difficult to drive tough manual gearbox really harsh ride great for some high performance fun but you wouldn't want to to drive it every single day like that and so in that analogy the Rog phone is like a Porsche 911 where it's taking the high performance stuff but it's also easier to daily drive at least it would like to be a Porche 911 so as far as performance goes as crazy as it sounds there's really not that much to say here this is now the fastest phone I've ever used not even on paper but just as far as pure responsiveness and feeling like my every touch and input is immediately responded to this sets The Benchmark now for me I drag my finger across the display and everything moves about as perfectly one: one as I've ever seen scrolling animations opening up apps multitasking all that stuff it's just crazy fast it's the new chip of course Snapdragon 8 plus gen 1 but also this is now the fastest screen I've ever used the 165 HZ display and it's running with a 720 HZ touch sampling rate that's double last year which brings the touch latency down 23 milliseconds so you really notice things just follow your finger around the screen being super tight and everything being real Snappy across the board you know if it's synthetic benchmarks you care about here they are they'll show you it is slightly more powerful and also slightly more power efficient than the Snapdragon 8 gen 1 and technically still behind the iPhone 13 but I'm telling you right now nine times out of 10 the r feels faster than anything else and then even with the little stuff his phone just goes all the way to the max for performance it has ufs 3.1 storage it has lpddr5 Ram instead of DDR3 uh it even has Wi-Fi 6E any spec that you can think of at the very Max this phone has it so I don't even have to be a hardcore gamer or a PBG Enthusiast or anything to understand that if you throw a game at this phone it's probably going to be able to handle it so I'm going to leave the gaming testing to the gaming enthusiasts but then what about all the time that you're not gaming that's probably even more time than when you actually do play games on the phone how does the sports car drive when it's not on the track spoiler alert pretty good there is 18 gigs of ram in this phone like I said do you really need 18 gigs of RAM to play a single game no I don't think so I think that's for the headline but lots of RAM does help with multitasking so I find myself using the phone flipping back and forth between five or six open apps easy it keeps up no problem keeps them all open this is also the best display yet on a gaming phone not just in refresh rate but in brightness and overall quality they keep getting better this is a Samsung built moled panel that they've tuned to be really really fast but it's still got improvements in color accuracy it's hdr10 plus certified and it gets up to 800 nits it's not quite Flagship levels but very usable outdoors and in most environments the haptics are way better this is one of the things that was bad in the last phone but the they turn the haptics all the way up they've got a new motor in here and so anytime you're scrolling or typing or bouncing back and forth on things you really feel the clicky it's good it's good haptic motor and the underd display fingerprint reader which also was bad on the last phone is much faster so it seems like Asus was at least listening about the stuff we were nitpicking about in the last Rog phone for daily use you probably also noticed triple cameras on the back just like the R5 these are passable cameras so they have a new 50 megapixel primary camera like I said in here it's giving me decent images to their credit Asus usually has pretty good software tuning from my experience but I'm getting B minus to B+ pictures in good lighting it's just not very consistent with exposure or contrast so some of them look fine some of them just like flat and a little Overexposed to give you an idea this is a Sony IMX 766 sensor the same one you see in phones like the Oppo Find X3 and the OnePlus Nord 2T both of which are under 600 bucks you're probably not buying this gaming phone for the cameras but at least for the money you'd like it to be able to keep up with the other premium priced Flagship phones out there and it's just just a level behind it's nipping at their heels matter of fact let's just get it all in one place now so if you were thinking about getting a phone like this and these following things don't scare you off then it might be a good phone for you ready so the cameras definitely a weakness especially the camera layout Choice like even if this primary camera is passable I hate this camera layout it's a primary camera than a 13 megapixel Ultra wide which is a little softer and worse whatever that's not a shock but then the third camera is a macro camera instead of an ultra wide and it's not even a good macro camera so the cherry on top is they bury the macro mode like deep in the settings and like alternate photo modes so you'll almost never actually use it but they do prominently have a 2X button right here in the normal viewfinder which is just a 2X crop on the main camera you don't have a telephoto camera just put a telephoto camera there instead anyway so that's one then there's no wireless charging so they reor ented the Rog Vision display on the back of the phone it still does light up and play animations when the screen is on and when it's charging when you have an incoming call or any other notifications it's still super customizable and very unique to this phone but it does mean there's no room on the back for wireless charging so that's another thing and then there's just the sheer size of this phone like I say it every year but it's like the biggest phone that I review and uh it's not even it's not trying to be Sleek at all they've kept the huge bezels around on the top and the bottom huge stereo front-facing speakers in there it's thick but hey you know what it's a form factor where if you're gaming a lot you spend a lot of time holding it in Landscapes so you're going to need some spots for your thumbs so you don't block the screen when you're gaming that's all good it's got some extra thickness for extra cooling you got that extra USB port on the side that's good for charging the 6,000 Mah hour battery at up to 65 Watts with the included charger so that's the double play of great battery life and very fast charging and a headphone jack I mean it's just Asus and Sony keeping headphone Jacks around in their premium phones at this point but just you know all this stuff takes up space it's a big phone so uh yeah I also there's like little things like the ipx4 water resistance rating isn't quite up to flagships of this price might not matter to you unless you get really really sweaty while gaming I don't know but overall Rog phone 6 pro at the top of the lineup is a great overall bump up from rg5 ultimate it's what they're calling it so yeah it's a great high-end super performance oriented phone wrapped in a cyberpunk package with text printed all over it uh and it happens to be a pretty good daily phone too if those couple of things don't get to you and you know there's still there's going to be people always out there who want the crazy exotic McLaren or hardcore Lamborghini stiff suspension real tight steering handling and that's fine but I guess the difference is in the car world people who get cars like that usually have a different car that they drive most of the time daily and then they have the fun car but for a phone you typically just have one phone so you need it to do double duty so I do think the softening of this gamer phone into a more palatable daily phone and more well-rounded phone is a good thing so yeah props Asus for that good looks either way that's been it thanks for watching make sure you subscribe if you haven't already and I'll talk to you guys in the next one peace","At night 🌃 time

cCCBDhdcSGw,Reviewing MKBHD Videos!,"Working back to my first video, trying to survive the cringe The Masterclass: http://masterclass.com/MKBHD Why Don't People ...",2022-07-02T16:47:14Z,2746130,121711,3938,"[Music] so on one hand it's nice that you can look back at your previous work and see a difference and actually know that you're getting better at something but on the other hand it is kind of embarrassing when all that old stuff is still up and it's just not good but I've been making videos more or less for about 13 years or almost 14 years now which is crazy to say out loud but the thing that I think I'm most most proud of as far as the video making process is that pretty much all of it is selftaught there there is no how-to guide for creating a tech Channel and making videos and and making a business out of it until now we we basically have created the blueprint I got to basically crystallize this blueprint in the form of a master class I actually got to make a master class which is pretty amazing it's in pretty special company I mean I've watched NE degrass Tyson's master class and I got to talk to him in person we just watched Steph Curry win an NBA championship with the Warriors and he did a master class and so to celebrate I'm going to go back and look at my older videos uh or at least I'll go back in time slowly and try to survive the cringe I'll review them a bit maybe shed some light on uh the behind the scenes process on some of the stuff that we did to make it happen uh and we'll see how far we get back as they get increasingly more and more old let's do it all right so this first video I'm going back to is already October 2020 so it's about 2 years old this is the Sony xaria 1 Mark I reviews of smartphones has kind of become the bread and butter of the channel and I've definitely noticed that stepping outside of that a little bit more has been more fun lately and this is one of those videos Snapdragon 865 8 gigs of RAM a 21 by9 widescreen display triple cameras a 4,000 mAh battery really it's like smartphones have gotten so consistent and a lot of people just say boring which makes a lot of sense for this video it's like the the first two minutes of it is just quickly explaining what this exact phone is but then we jumped right into all the more interesting questions about like why this Sony phone if you didn't already notice the two in the background the two lights that's for the xaria 1 Mark II there's there's always some Easter egg in every video fine but you know technically anybody can build that but the thing is this phone also has a bunch of other stuff unique really useful stuff that I haven't seen in any other phone but all this stuff leads to one question which is why don't more people buy these okay so this video so this is why don't people buy Sony's phones from two years ago it has 7.1 million views and I I just tweeted this the other day because it was so interesting like I like their phones and I talk about them but these videos average more views per video about the phone than like any other brand I found it funny because they they still have like 0% market share but there's just a couple factors in between Sony actually getting real customers and not one of them being the fact that there's like months between when they announce the phone and it comes out the other one being that it's $1,500 it's frustrating because it seems like Sony's kind of suffering from some of the same stuff LG has lately anyway which is their inability to RG all right I think we can go older okay so this video here is the Samsung Galaxy fold unboxing from 2019 23 million views the retail in of the Samsung Galaxy fold Bo this is an interesting one this is the first foldable phone that's really going on sale to the masses it's priced way higher than even any other high-end Samsung Flagship so it's clearly positioned as a luxury device so this this video style is pretty similar still to you know 3 years ago to to now it's close the funny behind the scenes story about the fold though that I I've kind of told but maybe I'll just put it all in one place here uh you guys already know it broke and there was lots of stories that came out about it I actually got a shot of me peeling the screen protector off and it breaking on camera but it never made it to the internet because what happened was I'd shot this whole unboxing and first impressions video and the magnet paper and all that fun stuff and then as I was editing it I said oh you know what I didn't get a shot yet of taking the screen protector off so I set up the camera and got the shot of peeling the screen protector and got it I mean it shut down as I was peeling it off so I had that shot and I said oh that's bad well let me get back to that so I finished editing the unboxing video published that and then the next day I'm like trying to figure out what happened to the screen and then another person on Twitter saying hey me too hey me too and so I chimed in on Twitter Hey mine also broke and that's when the Avalanche of Galaxy fold screen breaking stuff happened there were very very few review units this was one of them they were all taken back so there's a magnet in each side of the Galaxy fold about 2/3 of the way down as demonstrated by this magnet paper the magnet paper is so it's just so fun it's Evergreen Everyone likes seeing where the magnets are and things and this paper every time I use it in a in a Instagram post in a Tik Tok even it's just fun we just like the magnet paper so they're so strong that they have a a bit of a field effectively outside of the phone itself strong enough enough to pick up metal objects and things like yeah I remember that a bunch of washers nails or even whole bags of nails what a weird feature and I even had a small wrench that worked and an apple pencil which of course has a piece of metal in it for the iPad's magnet that worked and uh a really really big Allen key it's made of metal and it can pick it up this magnet Is For Real so just had to share that a little proof from what I was talking about from the last video so you can see in the background this is in the old Studio we're in uh a different part of the same building now but I I can picture almost with photographic memory exactly where everything in this old Studio was until we moved out the retr tech episode one on the original game boy it's a good time to be a video nerd either way thanks for watching okay so the clock in the background or the the little screen as you can see 8, 34,9 62 subscribers that was a live counter at that time when YouTube didn't round now they just round to the nearest this would say 8.3 but they used to actually tell you how many catch you guys in the next one peace still similar in style I've had the same uh camera stuff setups I've used a lot of the same lenses since 2019 so I think we can go even older so this is the htcu ultra rant SL revie from 2017 I mean it's my channel I'm I get to talk about the things that I like and that I'm interested in and so the process for like deciding what to make videos about is like when something is so cool or so good that I I want to talk about it then it gets a video and then there's this like gray area in between and then there's the stuff that's so bad that it needs like a PSA or people need to know not to buy it yeah if you don't think I did negative videos you should probably watch this one [Music] remember this Notch this weird side what's up guys I'm kbd here and this is the brand new HTC I don't know why I look different it's probably the lack of oh it's the beard that's what it is it's definitely the beard U Ultra and it is definitely the shiniest phone of all time and this happens to also be HTC's first big smartphone of 2017 and it's coming to the US with a price tag of 700 $49 so this is definitely a that used to be a lot of money for a smartphone the Galaxy Note 7 clean top down shot which stands for extra large and it's bigger than all of those and even others with even smaller displays it's bigger than all of them and it's still 8 mm thick so it's also definitely not trying to be a super thin phone in any way either so okay so the these shots here this is what we used to do a little bit more often before we had enough of a studio space to really make a large variety of shots we'd use this thing called breather which is it's originally supposed to let people just rent a space in the city and just like take a breather or study or read or hang out and they all look kind of cool and cooler than our studio so I would use this as a like mobile video Studio that pop up to New York City and the portless future isn't quite here yet and HTC you definitely could have also but you didn't for some reason seems like a poor use of space and then the battery the htcu ultra has a 3,000 mAh battery which does doesn't seem that bad but for context yes something's a little bit off here you I love this I mean this is one of my favorite videos to put together not because I like trashing on phones but this is one of the earlier times in a video in a review or something like this where I I spended an extra bit of effort to make sure that there's a Common Thread throughout the video a really poor use of space poor use of space seems like a poor use of space seems like a poor use of space poor use of space this doesn't always work with phones or reviews at all but when it does it's great for obviously retention and for enjoying the video the whole way through because you know what you come away from the video with with that I'll say skip this one and you can pretty easily wait for the htc11 to come out pretty soon or just grab a Galaxy S8 when that comes out or an LG G6 or pretty much any other $700 smartphone which will be a better use of space than this one so that's been it hope you enjoyed yeah there's been uh there's been quite a few videos uh with said tone in the past no big deal there's a there's a lot of fun of trying to figure out you know trying to tow the line between what to talk about and not to talk about all right let's get older this is the most nervous I think I've ever been in my life so this is in 2015 and it it's it's kind of out of the blue and random for the channel I've been talking about tech and gadgets and handheld stuff and Along Comes this email from Nike saying hey Kobe Bryant's releasing a new signature shoe this is in the middle of his farewell tour and his legendary final NBA season and uh there's some tech in it and we figure it would be cool to invite you to come talk to him about it you down what yeah okay sure of course yeah I don't know if I still don't think I'm that good of an interviewer but this is what the talking Tech series since then is this is what it's all about from a tech perspective you know I've I've kind of tried to dabble into it a little bit but I found myself not being extremely passionate about it um unless it's centered around sports right and things that involve um Health Training um things of that sort um but overall I wouldn't describe myself as a very techsavvy person love the brutal honesty this is the thing about Kobe like when he cares about something he dives into it I have no idea yeah what a CD player Star Struck that let alone a Walkman it was like wait you had the rewind what when wait when that song was over you had to flip it over and use the other side of the tape yeah yeah so you know um when I first came in lead the world was such a different place this is also this is a three camera shoot I remember we we took three cameras out there I shot um with a friend John from TLD today awesome with making videos and this is also the last video that I ever edited in Adobe Premiere shoe be roll the shoe must it's harder than phone bureau when you're used to phone bureau but it's the same shot in my hand uh some free technology we've combined some of the zoom and lunar technology with have been some of the Staples with some of my other shoes um but they normally behave in isolation they normally don't communicate with each other this is like way more in-depth information that I actually thought I would get normally you get someone who's like doing a sort of a promo tour and they're just like oh yeah watch my new movie oh yeah buy my new product he's literally explaining how like Nike flying it works with the ankle of the shoe and how he has more torque around the heel but less around the sides so there Mobility with the shoe it's crazy thanks for being a part of this I appreciate the time uh and hopefully we get to do it again thank you awesome that's that was the first of like the interviews that I ever did in hindsight I feel like I have a lot to thank Kobe for I mean I obviously that was the only time I ever met him I remember when I first we went to go set up the video stuff and the guy was like all right yeah so Kobe when he walks in he's going to go and go over to the left and he's going to do this interview then he's going to go over here and do this interview then he's going to come to you and do that interview and then he's going to head out my heart's in my throat he comes over and he's the nicest guy and he helps sort of break the ice and I heard you doing this YouTube thing this is cool let's talk about tech incredible we need more guys like him all right this is we're going back to 2014 now so this is a in case it looks kind of crazy already this is a video I shot in collaboration with the verge's video team they have an amazing video team they still do to this day but this is like the they they're in their Prime of like this crazy ultrawide video and and you know a very recognizable Style with Motion Graphics so this is a collab shoot also uh my hand is broken because uh as you can see there's some stitches I and practice uh I just broke my hand like a week or two before I shot this it's fine though we can still shoot a video kind of like the Galaxy Note 4 and I take the Finish from the Nokia Lumia Series so at motions soft touch is obviously easier to hold and 2014 this was State ofth art it's funny that 5 and half Ines was a massive display back then and now I think the mini iPhone is just a little smaller than that so inside we got to have top-notch specs so here in late 2014 that means Snapdragon 805 3 gigs of RAM uh the adreno 420 GPU basically the whole deal so for the battery motor the whole deal I uh I'm reviewing a phone right now with 18 gigs of RAM just for context and are better did you see that fully transl and a dream phone I'd be okay with anything 3500 milliamp hours or better this it says this transition we were using if you pause it at the right place it says film impact demo on the right here is an LG ad and then on the right here is a Samsung phone ad and in the next shot there's a Google Android ad these things are everywhere I think that's why we shot this year because I said oh for the operating system Android but also I'm shooting this right around Time Square and I have if you look over the left side of the frame that tall billboard very recently we just got a team C's billboard put on that exact super tall billboard where the ball ball drops in Time Square I also have a shot of my own face on a Time Square billboard recently it's crazy how that works out pigeons flying behind me and then the Verge MKBHD collabs see that was kind of neat all right so now we're going we're going really really far into the archives here this is where the cringe really hits so this is 2009 [Music] okay so I can explain I can explain it's hard to explain but I can explain even today I still have a short intro before the video so it was like you could make a short animation with some free tools and I wasn't skilled with video editing so I was just using free tools so this thing called Animoto you could put in a couple of photos animation for you you know this is the first place I ever made videos which is in the corner of my bedroom in my parents house I'm on the webcam of the first computer I ever had which was the HP Pavilion dv7t I used this computer for like the first 400 videos so what I'm going to go into is that right now I have I'm going to check right now right now I have approximately 70 I sound like Elmo just going to put that out there if I go to my page youtube.com/ Marcus brownley just click on the link over there I have 74 subscribers I clearly was not making money from this had no intentions of this being my job at any point it was just a fun thing I enjoyed doing when I got back from practice I'm literally like wearing my hoodie from after practice before I had to go do my homework I would just like make a video cuz it was fun what else can I tell you I mean video 100 uploading more run out of things to say stay tuned for more battery tips I'm still uploading more battery tips for you guys desktop well it was actually back in the day when I used to get an email for every single person who ever subscribed to the channel and when they did I would click on their profile and I would leave a message thanking them for subscribing yeah all right that's basically it so uh thanks for watching subscribe and stay tuned for more and I hope you like this video peace peace never never didn't have that let's go all the way back this is the best place to end it here we go um bought a new laptop and they literally this is the so this is the first video I ever made January 2009 I turn on the laptop webcam and I just start talking and then I realize that my glasses are reflecting the laptop screen and I just take them off I just panic and take them off I don't know who told me to pop my color like that okay so yeah quite a nice remote so quite a nice video Center remote this is like those old makeup tutorials where you got to hold it up to the camera like this because there's autofocus I don't know if I can make through the whole video without cringing let's try um these this I'm like struggling with like the fact that it reverses so when I move left it moves right so I move back to try to keep it in the frame fast forward your play Med controls yes it's a media player remote all and all it's pretty handy I it fits in your pocket quite easily it's as you can see I have a big hand but it's pretty small wow I said that in the first video leave comments and subscribe thanks that was fun I hope we'll probably do this again some some future version where I look back at 2020 videos and cringe but hey until then this has been it if you want to check out the master class link below that'll also be there but uh yeah thanks for hanging around and sticking to this and subscribing and being here for the videos guys catch you in the next one [Music] Peace Love a train horn","Almost 3mil

pSdKnNj7ozk,M2 MacBook Pro: Why Does This Exist?,M2 MacBook Pro is the MOST confusing existence...unless you're an enterprise custom who simply doesn't care Bar chart with ...,2022-06-29T21:48:30Z,3161900,108039,4815,"all right so this is the new 13in M2 MacBook Pro and I don't think anyone should actually buy it wait what yeah no I think it's a great computer first of all don't get me wrong but with the introduction of the M2 MacBook Air and the existence of the 14-in M1 Pro MacBook Pro they've manage to squeeze any reason for this machine to exist at this price to basically zero no should buy it yeah but nobody that I mean that seems pretty harsh matter of fact I'm here let me challenge you on that this is a great computer changed my mind okay well let's just start with the design so Apple's been going through their laptop lineup upgrading everything with this new square shape larger displays with thinner bezels getting rid of the touch bar and actually adding ports but this particular refresh didn't get any of that so this brand new laptop looks exactly the same as the M1 MacBook Pro from 2 years ago which looks exactly the same as the 13-in Intel MacBook Pro with a touch bar that dropped in 2016 because it is exactly the same I could give him sustainability credit I guess for recycling an old design and apparently using the same boxes from the M1 MacBook Pro just with new stickers on them but yeah this exact shell design is literally 6 years old and is starting to look kind of out of place now next to Apple's other notebooks like can you imagine any other company trying to reuse a six-year-old design like you trying to tell me a 2016 Asus laptop re-release would fly today like a six-year-old XPS Drop Like that's wild yeah but this isn't that like let me tell you uh if it ain't broke don't fix it and I'm not just saying that like this is a really good laptop design All Metal Jacket A+ hinge and let me just remind you you reviewed it and you loved it the screen was bright and high resolution still is the speakers were Best in Class still are great trackpad and keyboard and by the way some people do really like the touch bar you said so yourself it might not do a whole lot but it still has its few advantages okay but that that is in a vacuum like that's the thing by itself I would agree with you this computer is a perfectly good laptop buy it but as soon as you put it alongside the new Macbook Air which is basically the same price it's actually worse at basically everything like I got hands- on time with the new M2 MacBook Air that's about to come out next month right the air has a larger display with thinner bezels and in that Notch there's a new 1080p webcam instead of a 6-year-old 720p webcam it has mag safe with a color matching cable which enables fast charging and essentially frees up an extra Port since that's one more USBC Port that you're not plugged into and it's all in a package that's thinner weighs less and is basically the same price so why would you buy this MacBook Pro how is it even Pro anymore you know what that's a good question why would you buy this Pro the answer I think first of all is it is the cheapest pro in the lineup technically it's true but really the reason you get this over the air is the thicker chassis supports active cooling so it's got a fan and all the benefits that come with that I mean the benchmarks are in and to the surprise of absolutely no one it's pretty clear that this M2 Chip is awesome it's living up to the 10 to 20% better multi-course CPU performance and even more impressively the two extra GPU cores over M1 is giving it 30 to 40% better GPU performance which is basically the only area where you could say M1 was lacking so this is awesome for any applications that lean on the GPU everything's faster Final Cut is faster Premiere is faster any games you might play are all faster and the cherry on top is it has a dramatically improved media engine same one from the higher end chips actually so you can actually pull off some heavier Final Cut Pro edits so for something like that when you're in a program for hours and things are getting hot okay that's when you need the fans to kick in keep performance High longer than the MacBook Air ever could no throttling so if you've got the sustained workloads and the long performance stuff you should get the M2 MacBook Pro no no those people should just go straight to the 14in M1 Pro MacBook Pro just go straight to the big brother look if you know you're going to be doing workloads and things that the MacBook Air can't handle then you should just go to the actually Pro laptop the upgraded machine if you're going to get a nice laptop and you want to do extra performance stuff on it you weren't going to get the base line MacBook Pro right you were going to bump it up first of all because you want at least 16 gigs of memory right and second of all because the 256 gigs of Baseline Pro Storage is kind of insulting and that version has particularly clipped SSD performance worse than even the M1 MacBook Pro so to get to 1 tbte and 16 gigs you're already looking at like $1,900 for this machine at that point just get the 14-in pro because that laptop is on another level of performance I mean don't get me wrong it's absolutely awesome to see the jump from M1 to M2 and that's going to enable a ton more great stuff for the most popular laptop for the everyday Baseline users but if you zoom out there's still a big difference in performance when moving up to the higher end chips M1 Pro and then M1 Max the amount of additional performance you get for the extra $200 to $300 is massive if that's what you really want that's what you should get plus you get a much better brighter mini LED High refresh TR screen too and the webcam and the notch is way better and much better speakers and you actually get some ports while you're at it so I just I don't know you shouldn't get a literal worse version of all of those things I mean two to 300 bucks isn't nothing I mean it's not zero but like I don't know really squeezes this new Macbook Pro quite a bit and plus you can't get around the fact that it's it's literally worse at all those things I think you're forgetting something uh oh really the MacBook Pro has studio quality microphones while the MacBook Air does not um I mean so technically they both are listed as having triple microphone arrays with beam forming it's just Apple chose to call the one in the MacBook Pro studio quality it might have a slight difference but really are you going to pay extra for that and then sacrifice all this other stuff okay I think there is one redeeming factor and what is that battery the MacBook Pro has surprisingly excellent battery life better than I think pretty much all of us expected we saw the 20 hours of video playback quoted on stage but in real world use this might be the best battery life in any modern laptop we've ever seen there's people out here getting 16 to 20 hours of actual real world use the verge's laptop reviewer Monica wrote a hilarious piece about how long it took her to run down a battery and across the board it's a tremendously long performer so if you want the best battery in any laptop get this one okay so that is awesome to see uh but at the same time those other laptops already have great battery life too so you're not trying to spend just to get a slightly better battery and then sacrifice all those other things we talked about it's really quite a small difference uh so the ideal customer for this new Macbook Pro M2 is somebody who just needs a slightly better sustained performance than the new Macbook Air and is willing to sacrifice screen size webcam speakers ports thickness and weight to get it or someone who is literally about to buy the 13-in M1 MacBook Pro Enterprise yep Enterprise that's it","Your twin brother is so gifted. Feature him more😅 | 2025, I'm still using it, because the screen has higher pwm hz than any other pro MacBook | NOPE I have had other MacBooks and the last one I bought in 2023 is the one I currently own which is the MacBook Pro 13” M2 2022 and I tell you this thing is a beast, amazing. You would know the difference if you’re like me and have used older MacBooks and then used the newer and I think the M2 2022 with the Touch Bar is just as fast, doesn’t break down on me, realiable, I find the touch bar even useful as shortcuts and faster plus the quality and colors are great! There is a difference from the 2016 to the 2022 and I applaud apple seriously. I don’t trust guys like these cuz their job is to just make videos about products but they never actually use the technology on a day to day basis like people like us before they “review” it, they pick and choose what they want to say is good or bad. So don’t go off of one second reviews, go off of real reviews. Please 🙏🏽 | Nope. It's optics for me. I purposefully got this M2 MBP instead of a 14"" one because I just think the 14"" Pro machines are damn ugly. The new Airs are ok-ish with their slim shape but the older design and smaller size of the 13"" model just speak to me on another level. That curved bottom which makes the body appear even thinner than it actually is – that is top ""no notch"" design (if you know what I mean hehe).
Plus, I can easily regulate the keyboard backlight via touchbar. This really grinds my gears on the newer designs: that useless microphone button and the omission of my 1-click backlight regulating feature. | I mean for just a bar you go with base m2 MacBook Pro waste some dollars on that instead buy m2 air I have it it has MagSafe it cost less | No, it’s the touch bar for me | school gave us this in 2024 | I have this MacBook Pro and on;y felt that this was the better buy due to the great price I got for it in the refurbished Apple Store at the time. It was about 200 of savings for the same specs as the MacBook Air at that time, which was enough for me. Great laptop, could I have spent more for a better one, yes. However, the deal was too good to pass up. Still using this laptop today and no hiccups in my workflows | Purchased this laptop in April 2024 refurbished with 512 GB Storage 16 GB Memory. Primarily use it for photo editing in Lightroom and some video editing in Final Cut Pro but nothing extensive. Other than that I use it for the typical Microsoft Office Suite apps and internet browsing. Love the compact size and does everything I need it to do. Only downside is no SD card slot and the adapter can be finicky but for $1,299 thought it was a good deal. Especially coming from my 2014 MacBook Air...feels like a MASSIVE upgrade. | ok but the touchpad is so cool"
CkoquiSnqbk,Ford F150 Lightning is the iPhone of Pickup Trucks!,Ford's F150 Lightning is actually the most important vehicle they've made in a long time. MKBHD Merch: http://shop.MKBHD.com ...,2022-06-24T19:33:48Z,3628686,121597,6408,the f-150 lightning is the iphone of pickup trucks like it's not new new we've had pickup trucks before but this is the first very clearly in a new generation that will all be different and so lightning also lightning so [Music] okay so if you've ever driven around the united states and just looked for more than a few seconds you'll find it impossible not to notice that there are ford f-150s everywhere and it's not just on construction sites it's on the roads it's at grocery stores it's taking the kids to school it has been the most popular vehicle not the most popular truck the best selling vehicle in america for the past 30 plus years in a row and it shows and so that's exactly why the f-150 lightning is a really big deal especially for ford it's kind of like you probably know someone like this people who have older iphones who are not really considering getting any other phone other than a new iphone don't really know which new iphone but eventually they will upgrade to one of the newer iphones it might not be you and i but there's a lot of people just like that here with their ford trucks so i've been driving and living with the all-electric f-150 lightning for a couple days now enjoying its tons of features living in a world of an electric pickup truck and i am very impressed but it's not me they have to impress it's the whole world of f-150 loyalists and pickup truck buyers that are waiting for the next convincing f-150 upgrade before they buy one again basically if the future of cars is electric then this is one of the most important cars in the world so in a lot of ways it doesn't actually matter how this thing drives like i could talk to you all day about driving dynamics but most people buying a truck like this aren't too concerned with that but the fact is it is actually better than a regular f-150 in a couple of ways one it's much quieter you can turn on the propulsion sound which i haven't but it's very quiet for a truck and then two it is much smoother i'm a big fan of the one pedal driving option a lot of evs don't have the option you should always have the option this gives you that so the regenerative braking is pretty smooth the pedal calibration is pretty smooth and overall it's it drives pretty well and if you want to kick it in a straight line you definitely can this happens to be the first f-150 with independent rear suspension and that's actually just a result of the way they built the car with the battery pack underneath but otherwise it drives the same way as the other f-150s if you're used to a big truck it drives like a big truck if you're used to being high above the road it's still high above the road and that's actually important it's got to feel familiar it's got to feel like the truck you're used to and in so many ways it still does just a little better but clearly it does not look too out of place on a road i drive past other f-150s all the time it looks exactly the same from the outside if you don't look at the badges if you don't know what to look for as far as the bar headlights and the bar tail lights yeah this is very much familiar and that's a good thing it's supposed to be we just need an ev version of a car that's already very well accepted and ford did that with the name mustang but they really did it with the entire truck here with the f-150 even if nothing else is different about the f-150 lightning against the gas f-150 lightning the one thing it does have is called the mega power frunk which will make a lot of sense if i open it it beeps for a second to let me know it's going to open then it opens to reveal 400 liters or 14 cubic feet of enclosed storage which pickup trucks normally don't have that's bigger than the trunk of a toyota corolla so it's a real trunk you can put up to 400 pounds of stuff in here there is a false floor at the bottom underneath which you will find space for your charging cable but even without that there's plenty of space for bags grocery shopping you can fit a full set of golf clubs in here like i've done in the past but it's also called the mega power frunk because you can kind of just operate again work out of the front there's four full-size outlets over here a usb-c port a a port or if you just want to use it as a tailgating but what's the opposite of a tailgate whatever as a cooler you can fill it with ice and there's a drain hole in the bottom so this becomes the place where you sort of party out of your truck it's just multi-purpose in every way but really the cherry on top is this is the feature that would visually differentiate it and make it obvious that this truck was different from the others like this would pull up in a parking lot alongside all the rest of the other trucks there and no one would bat an eye unless you recognize the badging or the tail light bar or the headlight bar you wouldn't know but the second the front truck opens that's when other truck owners heads would turn like wait that that's not the same thing as a truck i have so that is the main fun part of the lightning's mega power frunk you can also fit a human body in it so i could point out the work truck theme and how it's present all over the f-150 lightning but it would also be kind of redundant because that's all over every f-150 you know spray-in truck liner how massive this thing is all the measuring equipment on the side but my favorite part is definitely how many power outlets this thing has and everything it can power because it's essentially a giant battery bank probably the biggest battery bank you'll ever have so the trunk has a whole bunch of 120 volt outlets it has a 240 volt outlet that's your power tools your air compressor whatever else you want it to be but then the inside of the cab you've got full-size outlets in there too usb ports wireless charging the frunk like i said also has power but the best part of it is the truck can power your house if you wanted it to so ford sells an inverter you put it in your garage and you plug this thing in and it can back up your house if it loses power for days at a time several times the size of a tesla power wall so that's pretty sick i guess the point i'm making is even though i'm not in the market for an f-150 lightning i love this thing some new evs are super different from the rest of the company's lineup but as i keep saying this one's basically the same and that's on purpose of course the similarity in parts makes for much easier cheaper manufacturing which by the way is already top-notch from the company that literally invented the assembly line and the familiarity of the f-150 brand lends itself to people being more likely to give it a shot but also not only is this just another f-150 but it's the best f-150 ever made the f-150 lightning is more powerful than the most powerful gas f-150 it has more horsepower and more torque than the best gas f-150 it has a massive max towing capacity the most covered cargo space the most high-tech features it has the least maintenance it's the least expensive per mile to run and own and by the way it's the fastest quietest smoothest and the easiest to drive if any of that matters to you so it delivers it delivers on the promise and i can see it making a lot of the pre-order holders happy we even used a second f-150 lightning to shoot this first f-150 lightning so it's already putting in work my only question going in was about range you know you might have remembered some of the things left unclear from my impressions video so this extended range version promised 300 miles i lived with it for a week and i found that real world use gets you a little bit below that which is not surprising about 280 but then there's even a sick feature that measures how much you're either hauling or towing with a built-in scale and then adjusts your estimated range from there which is a great idea for a truck which we'll be towing and hauling all the time so here we are ford's gonna start shipping these we'll see how fast they can ramp up manufacturing and now it's up to the rest of the competition the electric ram the electric toyota tundra even the cyber truck the ones on the horizon it's up to all of them to catch up to this one thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace [Music],"What a joke - put a diesel in it and Australia will want it | What about offroading | The F150 Lightning takes the pickup EV lead. | With this EV, it is safe to say Ford caught lightning ⚡in a bottle. | I wonder if you can speed with it just the same too! | In the tech world, people that know what they're doing in any case, anything proprietary is garbage.  iPhones are proprietary.  Comparing this vehicle to it tells me a lot.  It's a vehicle for people that don't know anything about technology, which is bad for you in the long run. | The stats on this didn’t hold up to well I guess.

mrkAmmMakMg,The Nothing Phone LOOKS Different,A hands-on with the whole glyph interface in lights on the back of this phone. Will that be enough to differentiate it? MKBHD ...,2022-06-21T13:15:27Z,8304415,307265,14221,[Music] hey what's up mkbhd here and yes this is the nothing phone the first phone from the startup that gave us the nothing year one earbuds in 2021 a big step into establishing their own ecosystem that they're building and it looks familiar but also very different so we live in an age right now where so many of the top phones the most popular phones are designed to appeal to the masses that's the point of them and so they all end up kind of looking basically the same all very similar you know big screen up on the front a couple cameras on the back a couple pale colors nothing too crazy just a glass slab so if a startup were to come along and make another average phone it would probably fit in pretty nice but there wouldn't really be any reason to switch to it to to buy that one so what nothing has done is they've made a pretty unique looking phone that also happens to have a bunch of cool features surrounding that unique look i think it's pretty sick now this phone isn't out yet fyi it's coming around july 12th so definitely get subscribed to make sure you see the full review of the entire phone and everything about it when it does come out um but until then what i am allowed to show you now is the back of the phone so the ear one earbuds that came from them last year played off of this transparency theme not fully transparent but definitely with some clear plastic bits that look cool and then reveal some shielding inside that's strategically placed and painted to look sweet that's kind of the look this phone also has going on too but the way that really stands out is with these lights on the back so the phone has what i would basically call the ultimate notification led so the notification led on the back of the phone has been a dying breed lately you don't see them very much but when you do which is rare it's so nice to just have like a subtle little glowing led that just tells you what's going on you can tell if you have a new phone call or text message or a new tweet and this is a sort of a exaggerated all-out version of that so there are just over 900 leds making up a pattern across the whole back of this phone around the dual cameras around the wireless charging pad in the middle and then some stripes up into the corner and then down by the charging port at the bottom and they do a great job frosting over them so the glow really cleanly appears as just a solid continuous light bar so they call it the glyph interface and it has a bunch of real functionality so first of all it does light up and pulse for your notifications it will also light up and glow when your wireless charging or reverse wireless charging which is neat but there's also a feature where when you plug into usbc to charge it lights up that bottom bar and then acts as a progress bar indicator and of course you wouldn't want that to stay lit up all the time so it turns off but anytime you want to check on it all you got to do is just wiggle the phone a little bit and it lights up again so you can see how far you've gotten that is dope the entire glyph interface can light up at once as a fill light for the cameras these are pretty bright leds normally some lights on the back of a phone i wouldn't say make much of a difference but for some sort of close-up subjects or in darker rooms this can actually make a difference versus the normal flash that's also on the back of the phone plus there is a blinking red light on the back here which is a recording indicator for when you're recording videos and then nothing has built an entire user interface into the settings that let you control exactly how the lights work when they turn on and what they light up for so the most impressive part to me for sure is there are 10 built-in ringtones and you might not use ringtones that much but these are cool they each have a light pattern that lights up to perfectly match the ring tone and so then you can pair ringtones with certain contacts so when you see a certain light pattern even when the phone is muted you know who's calling you just by looking at it and on launch you'll be able to have different light patterns for notifications from different apps too [Music] i imagine they can add more stuff like this through software updates over time but that is a really interesting actually new feature in a smartphone we don't see that very often so that's pretty cool now whether it'll be enough to actually get people to buy the phone or whether it impresses people who would usually put a case on their phone anyway that will have to wait until launch to see but i think it looks pretty sick honestly it looks like a movie prop in my hand in certain environments plus i'm sure there's a clear case coming from nothing i think now that there's like renders floating out there the most common description i've seen of the look of this phone is like oh it just looks like an iphone 12 with a transparent back which sure you know with the dual cameras and the general shape you could reduce it to that if you want to but also that's pretty cool actually but actually for what it's worth a clear backed iphone 12 would look like this which is a little bit different so love it or hate it nothing's phone looks kind of different so no matter what happens with the rest of the phone mission accomplished there i guess the question we're left with at this point is does this work like is this uh different enough looking to actually work are people going to buy it are they going to want to actually switch to this slightly different looking phone over this safe bet and i guess the answer really is it's a real strategy like look at these three phones there's a naruto phone a league of legends phone a dragon ball z phone all super unique deep collaborations with custom packaging custom designs wallpapers icon packs the whole thing they go the extra mile so this strategy of standing out with a cool features or sweet design is very intentionally to steal away a small amount of the most loyal customers it's literally a customer acquisition cost and maybe if the first run is successful enough then they can make a slightly more broadly appealing slightly better phone overall that sells more and if that one works then they can make an even more broadly appealing phone that sells even more and then even more broadly appealing and even more until you've made a very broadly appealing phone that sells the most but that feels like it abandoned your original fan base sound familiar either way this phone is definitely super different i think the lights are pretty cool but we'll have to see how it goes something to keep an eye on thanks for watching i'll catch you guys in the next one peace [Music],"Here after Carl Pie video to check the views.

xcjZvAFBH_Y,This Was Ahead of its Time!,"Top 3 Gadgets that were ahead of their time, and why they'll reappear in our future MKBHD Merch: http://shop.MKBHD.com ...",2022-06-11T16:25:12Z,5532887,179545,6235,i tweeted this recently just thinking about how vine was the home of short form vertical videos before it died in 2016. and now in 2022 tiktok has been the most downloaded app on the planet for like the last 12 straight months in a row and short form vertical videos are blowing up and i could reach no other conclusion than vine was ahead of its time you might look at the electric vehicle revolution that's happening right now around us and think wow we have a lot to thank tesla for but tesla wasn't anywhere near the first electric car that would technically be in the 1890s but even in the 1990s there was an electric car from gm called the ev-1 it was this little two-door electric coupe with a 55-mile range that sold less than 2000 units before being discontinued removed from the road and crushed now of course years later evs are on the rise everyone's turning their car companies entirely electric from the inside out but no one remembers the gm ev1 because it was ahead of its time and so that got me thinking there have been so many products that have launched over the years that have failed but just because the world wasn't ready for them yet and i have a few favorites that have come to mind and so these are my top favorite three gadgets that were ahead of their time so number three google glass this one's a classic i think a lot of people remember google glass but probably forget some of the crazier details so first of all this was back in 2013 nearly a decade ago and they revealed it in the craziest way they had skydivers literally jump out of a blimp while streaming an entire skydive live through google hangouts straight from glass where they eventually landed on top of the building google i o is happening in then they tore through the insides on bikes to get up to this stage i mean that's a pretty grand reveal for a pair of smart glasses with a head mounted projection display that would give you extra contextual information about the world around you i do remember this being the first genuinely useful looking pair of ar glasses though so you could see turn by turn navigation in front of you with google maps you could ask google assistant questions with your voice and just get it to show your results anywhere you're at or it could show you your notifications from your phone as they came in that was super nerdy to want to do all of this hands-free all the time by wearing something on your face but even at 1500 there was a lot of interest from nerds like me but just general curiosity from the public and google actually made this explorer edition that was a super limited edition run that would help them test them in real life but pretty quickly there started to become problems i mean i guess the first problem was that it looked like this which you know i mean it's cool that you have a camera and you can see like a first person view of photos and videos of things and share them but this was 2013 and people were absolutely not ready for people wearing a camera and a computer on their face it didn't have any sort of visual indicator on the outside that you were recording or taking photos so people started getting kicked out of movie theaters while wearing them because security thought they might be recording the movie and someone also got pulled over in their car and ticketed because the police thought they might have been watching a movie on google glass but even if you could get past the whole camera on the face thing like this is what it would look like to talk to somebody using glass you know the the button up here the glancing up to the side the touch pad if it wasn't like obvious already it was kind of unnatural to be talking to someone while doing that eventually google killed the project for consumers glass actually does live on through an enterprise version where it doesn't have to worry about looking like an everyday pair of glasses acceptable to wear in public but you can actually buy google glass enterprise edition 2 right now for your company where you can do live video or give step-by-step instructions on how to assemble things stuff like that but the point is it got utterly rejected by regular people by the public and we haven't seen it for years but it's 2022 now and it's very clear that head mounted displays vr and ar are all again right on the horizon and about to explode again snapchat has made multiple versions of their spectacles that let you share the world from your first person perspective that's a camera on your face facebook partnered with ray bans to make some sunglasses that record video and photos that's also a camera on your face and apple of course has had a rumored ar or vr headset for what feels like years now probably coming out in the next year or two and knowing apple designed to be worn and accepted by regular people and even at i o this year kind of a callback google did a one more thing and it was a pair of ar glasses but this time focusing on live translation so not quite the same thing as google glass but still it's a start google glass walked so these could run they were for sure ahead of their time alright so number two was the samsung galaxy camera so this is a bit of a lesser known gadget some of you might remember it but it was one of my favorite things ever so i want to give it its flowers so this is 2012 this is the same year as the galaxy s3 but this is basically a whole mirrorless camera with a galaxy s3 on the back so this is a 16 megapixel camera with a 21x optical zoom lens on the back all the processing power of a galaxy s3 with a quad-core chip on-board storage one gig of ram and it was running the newest version of android which at the time was android 4.1 basically the only thing it was lacking was an actual cellular radio to be able to make phone calls if you ask me great product idea great idea like obviously most cameras have pretty bad uis as far as navigating through them but even if they are pretty good they don't have an internet connection and a phone on the back and so how often are you just trying to take a picture and then do some quick edits in lightroom and then put it on instagram like just that quick workflow right there all the time that's exactly what this was built to do it had a smartphone display it had great performance it had the ui for it it was a dream so why did this fail well you could blame it on social media being a little bit older you could blame it on maybe a camera market being too small at that time people didn't want a dedicated camera but at the end of the day the real reason was turned out the camera wasn't that good the actual quality of the photos weren't that much better or easier to take than a galaxy s3 in the first place and so that's the reason the reviews were terrible and nobody actually wanted to buy the thing but in the background it was very clear that a real camera with a full android experience or a full ui on the back made a lot of sense like i said most camera uis currently pretty bad and even if they aren't they sure as hell can't edit a photo and then post it on twitter or instagram fun fact android was actually supposed to be a digital camera os before it got bought up by google and turned into a phone os so really makes you think but i think what it comes down to is basically there's a friction to get something from a camera to instagram there is taking the photo and then wirelessly transferring it to your phone maybe which is either going to compress it or it's going to take a long time and so most people most people would just take a photo with their smartphone it's easy it's good enough but for photographers for the creator class or people enthusiasts like myself that friction between getting a good shot and putting it online is the problem now there are other cracks at solving this there were two generations of the galaxy camera before it was cancelled last year zeiss made a camera called the zeiss zx1 it's a full-frame camera with a fixed 35 millimeter f2 lens that ran android and it also had lightroom mobile and instagram pre-installed which let you edit right there on the screen and immediately post but it was also six thousand dollars which is entirely out of reach for most people and also you couldn't install any other app besides lightroom and instagram and then there have been plenty of attempts from companies to make phones that have all the features of a full-time camera so panasonic cm1 comes to mind this is from 2014 and this had a one inch 20 megapixel sensor and a 28mm f 2.8 like a branded lens definitely looked like a full-blown camera but the rest of the phone wasn't good enough to justify people buying this one we even had sony try add-on lenses for your phone so here's another name for you sony qx10 i actually owned one of these i never reviewed it but it was a separate camera and lens that connects to your phone via bluetooth and pairs via nfc and just latches to the back of your phone to give you a better camera but even that was 250 dollars and didn't work perfectly every time you know how bluetooth is there's still so much friction and again at the end of the day most people totally fine with just the smartphone camera for most stuff they're putting on instagram i just did a video on the sony xperia 1 mark iv if you haven't checked that out already that one has real optical zoom so it's a better physical camera but again for photographers creators enthusiasts people like myself i maintain that we are ready right now for a good internet connected camera like brainstorming out loud imagine an iphone ui on a real full-frame mirrorless camera so a big sensor big lens but the processing power and computational photography with an m1 chip give this thing on board storage give it usb type c please and then you can throw pro in the name and that would be great yeah i would want one but until then yeah galaxy camera was ahead of its time so then number one last but not least is the motorola atrix does anybody remember the motorola atrix this was a smartphone it was a first phone with a dual core tegra 2 processor and it was the first android phone with a fingerprint sensor powerful stuff but most importantly it could connect to something called the motorola lap dock to give you a full laptop experience powered completely off of your phone it's like whoa wait a second what is a computer right i think we all basically like the general idea the concept that you only buy one computer and then you plug this one smallest computer into bigger and bigger shells to become a bigger and bigger form factor and a bigger and bigger computer because it's so powerful at its core right that idea is dope but there's two pretty big hurdles towards actually achieving that power and software so motorola with the atrix they attack the software problem head-on right so their version of android was called moto blur and when you plugged it into the lap dock immediately that would turn into an experience pretty similar to what we have with samsung dex now full-on laptop looking thing a dock apps windows the whole deal but the tougher challenge was definitely power right so this phone came out in 2011. the first dual core chip in any smartphone was a pretty big deal at the time but let's be real it's not powerful enough to be a full-fledged laptop photo editing video editing all that stuff much less even a chromebook at that time and so this actually kind of creates a third problem on its own basically which is if you buy into this ecosystem this version of that idea you're kind of stuck this atrix costs 200 bucks on a two-year contract but then the lap dock cost 500 extra dollars for basically a shell with a keyboard and a screen and a battery if you upgraded your phone you could no longer use your laptop so the atrix didn't hit right but now in 2022 the computing power in smartphones has come a long way people you know in benchmarks and reviews might think we're nitpicking and seeing if there's a difference between the snapdragon 8gen 1 and the triple eight but really the fact is all the extra headroom we're getting has way more functionality besides just texting and using the phone like normal it can become a computer we also already know the m1 chips powering the latest macbooks right now are based on a14 bionic from the iphone just scaled up so you can imagine plugging the smartphone into a larger form factor even if it's not a video editing machine still is a very capable laptop web browsing machine honestly even photo editing would probably go very smoothly just like the way we see it on ipads plus it's obviously great having all your messages but also all your apps and all your files just with you all the time no matter what machine you're using so this idea definitely has legs for the near future honestly the biggest problem that i see or the biggest obstacle in the way of it is still the ecosystem problem specifically because a company like apple would much rather have you buy an iphone and an ipad and a macbook than just to sell you one computer that can be everything so there are some third-party attempts at a modern version of this there's a company called next that makes the next dock this is basically the same thing as the atrix but over a usbc connection for samsung phones boom portable dex laptop but again that's only for samsung phones so really the fact that the whole ecosystem has to play for this idea to work makes it much harder than just one single gadget so the atrix was for sure ahead of its time and probably will be for a little while longer but i like the possibilities here i like where we're going with that one either way yeah vine was definitely ahead of its time fine walk so tick tock could run all right thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace,"Heh. This video is quite relevant now and insightful. | Great vid. The ideas were right. But the execution and timing were issues. Google glasses will come back with AI and a design by actual frame designers. | bruh, u click baited us | Thinking abt it now apple did the same kind of promo with their Vision Pro | I still, to this very day. wish with every fiber of my tech loving being. That Apple would do there own version of the google glasses. those looked SO DOPE. I feel like apples Continuity and Hand-off features covere the whole idea of having 'one device with multiple stations' Granted it's basically the oposite. But hand off can be REALLY handy. | Watching this video on my phone connected to a monitor using Dex. Ftw | Also the last Windows Phones did become a Windows computers | the bit about apple's vr glasses being designed to be worn and accepted by everyday people aged poorly | This aged well | Motorola: ""It has dual core!""

MjGMeMrH73I,M2 MacBook Air Impressions: Midnight Madness!,Hands-on with the new MacBook Air with M2 chip! My 2022 WWDC Reactions/Recap: https://youtu.be/4U2ZxO7b8iM MKBHD ...,2022-06-08T20:58:06Z,5734406,154793,6572,"[Music] all right so this is Apple's hot new laptop for 2022 and the First with the new second generation of Apple silicon inside we have a new Macbook Air and it's redesigned it's pretty sweet we got this announcement at WWDC on stage a couple days ago and I did get to spend some actual Hands-On time with the new laptop which is what this video is and after the half hour or so I actually got to spend with it I was left with one main thought and one new question the thought about the color and the question about the lineup so first of all I love the design refresh Apple's new laptop design language as we've seen from the previous MacBook Pros is very squared off so this MacBook Air is no longer wed shape it's very much rectangular with the sharper edges but it's still an air it's still razor thin 11.3 mm total Z height less than half an inch and 2.7 lb it kind of to me looks like two iPads sandwiched together basically still all metal still really well balanced and easy to hold definitely earns the air name right so on the right side there's a headphone jack with the new high impedence headphone support and on the left there's two Thunderbolt ports and they added magsafe and it'll actually come with a color matched magsafe cable which is new and it's a really nice touch so there's four new colors of this laptop silver space gray then Starlight and midnight so each mag safe cable uh matches the color of the laptop you plug it into the side it looks pretty seamless I just love them bringing back mag safe here and then with mag safe they also added fast charging up to 67 Watts with an optional power brick that's good for adding 50% charge in half an hour which is pretty good apple also showed us on stage there was this slide of a dual USB type-c charger which looks pretty sweet just a heads up though that one is not 67 Watts that's not the super fast charging that is 35 Watts I got to actually hold it and read that on the back of the brick so you can get either the fast charger or dual USBC charger anyway this laptop also gets a new Quad speaker setup it sort of Lo tucked in hinge underneath the display which is kind of cool and a new triple mic array with beam forming audio I I can't test that stuff in the limited Hands-On time I have with it in a huge Echo Steve Jobs theater so definitely get subscribed to see the review of that and all the other stuff I get to test when I actually get my hands on one but I think really the biggest change that I'm going to notice with this new laptop is at the front it's the display so in basically the same footprint as the last MacBook Air they thinned out the bezels all the way around making room for a slightly bigger 13.6 in display which is now also brighter at 500 nits basically matching the 13-in MacBook Pro and of course it now has the notch with the new 1080p webcam up there also this is Again part of the new Apple Pro aesthetic that honestly we're already getting used to as dorky as it looks when you just stare at it but anyway you also have a full height function row up at the top of the magic keyboard with Touch ID in the corner back lit Keys the whole deal I I mentioned in the last video Midnight this this new dark color might not be the way to to go I and I say that reluctantly cuz we love a good matte black but as you may know from the name of the color it's actually the same as the Apple Watch series 7 so it's not quite black it's slightly blue as hopefully you can tell from my Clips but also in my very very limited time playing with it uh it picks up a lot of fingerprints a lot and it was kind of hard to clean off so in my time handling it getting fingerprints all over the thing and getting kind of annoyed with trying to clean them off it made me lean way more towards like just safe space gray or maybe silver which would never show those fingerprints I don't know maybe maybe you just get a dbrand icon skin slap it on the back and never worry about it maybe you just don't care about the fingerprints and you just deal with it I'm just saying just putting it out there can't say I didn't warn you but the new M2 Chip inside is of course super important and this is what's going to make this ultra thin and light laptop actually perform and be very very impressive again going to do some testing and using it but Apple's promising some broad things like roughly 20% better SE CPU performance than M1 and 30 to 35% better GPU performance which is a pretty big jump over the M1 which is already very capable uh all within the same 18 hours of video playback really good battery life so it's impressive there's more memory bandwidth up to 100 gabyt per second more maximum system memory at 24 gigs but it's worth remembering this is still very much the Baseline chip right the M1 Pro and the M1 Ultra chips are definitely still higher-end chips and we can expect new generations of I guess an M2 Pro and an M2 Ultra at some point but yeah this M2 is targeted for Baseline everyday Computing and then occasional maybe some or Dem ending stuff it can handle stuff like video editing light gaming stuff you want to throw at it once in a while but here's where it gets interesting it is more expensive so I had no problem recommending the M1 MacBook Air at $9.99 right this is now like 2 years or so later this M2 MacBook Air starts at $1.99 so $1,200 laptop top it's a little more pricey but they're keeping the 2-year-old M1 MacBook Air with the old design in the lineup still at $9.99 so now you know at this price it's it's not like a instant recommendation for me and having a 2-year-old laptop not dropping price is also a little interesting but to me the weirdest part of this whole announcement of this lineup is the one other machine that they put this new M2 Chip in is the M2 MacBook Pro and this one got absolutely no redesign at all it is the exact same body and display and outside as the M1 13-in MacBook Pro they just bumped a new M2 Chip inside and so that machine will start at $12.99 and I just want to just talk about that for a quick second like I actually feel like you could make an argument that the M2 air which is cheaper is actually a better computer for most people for 90 something per of people you should probably just get the air look at this chart expect a new M2 MacBook Air and M2 MacBook Pro to cost the same amount with the same specs $14.99 right at this price though the air is thinner and lighter has the new better design has a larger display has Touch ID with a real function row which is I think better than a touch bar it has magsafe with the color matching cable it has fast charging that the pro doesn't have it has a much better webcam it has new speakers and microphones and it literally has more ports than the pro so the only advantage to the pro would be pairing the M2 Chip with a fan so the active cooling system can get you some extra performance out of sustained workloads like long renders and gaming I guess and then the slightly longer battery life from the bigger laptop having a physically larger battery but if you're already a person that's thinking about performance for sustained workloads and things like ports you're already going to be looking towards the M1 Pro MacBook Pro the 14inch so it's just kind of a weird sliver of people that I don't think are going to actually get very many M2 MacBook Pros just my thoughts on that real quick anyway uh that's pretty much it the air is a really good machine the one weird Quirk about it that I noticed is it still only supports One external display even though it has two ports now still only one up to 6K external display but is it good this is a good machine it's fun to hold and use and carry around and it makes a perfectly reasonable computer in a vacuum the M2 MacBook Pro look like a pretty bad deal either way I for sure going to get my hands on and test this thing let me know in the comments which color you think I should get I'm considering midnight right but we've seen the fingerprints so I I'm leaning maybe Starlight instead or space gray anything but silver I don't know let me know in the comments okay that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace","And yes the sensor dust is killing me too, but I wasn't about to try to clean the inside of the camera in the middle of a hands-on event 😅 | ñaña.alallalalla | lalalalal |

4U2ZxO7b8iM,WWDC 2022 Impressions: M2 Macs and iOS 16?!,"M2 Macs, iOS 16 and Editing iMessages? WWDC 2022 has it all Masterclass: http://masterclass.com/mkbhd 0:00 Intro 0:37 iOS ...",2022-06-07T06:37:43Z,4874596,287243,7067,I have this theory that the the new like animation that plays when you hit like on a YouTube video on mobile is just there to increase engagement it's the exact same thing as when you like a post with # WWDC now Apple has to pay for the hashtag but same idea anyway yo what's up MKBHD here so Apple's WWDC was today it's their developer conference so we know there's going to be a ton of software announcements and there was but of course we were expecting a little bit of an extra surprise on top maybe some hardware and we got that too so there's a lot to talk about today let's just jump right into it Philip def Franco so the biggest update is what's coming to iOS 16 this will be coming out eventually as an update to your iPhone and launching on the next iPhone when that comes out in the fall and there's a lot of new features here so the biggest one easily is the new overhaul to the lock screen on our phones so forever just for the longest time our lock screens on our iPhones have been the same thing it's the time at the top and then just a long list of notifications and then whatever your wallpaper was behind all that fine in iOS 16 the lock screen is way more I think the word is personalized which is actually not typical of what we see from Apple but this is a really nice update here so you can mess with not just the fonts and colors of your clock which is cool but it'll even play with your wallpaper a little bit so if you have a portrait mode photo or something with depth in your wallpaper that can look really cool but most importantly two things one notification s now will roll in from the bottom of the display it's the opposite of Android right now and that's much better for actually seeing your wallpaper and it's much more reachable if say apple is getting ready to sell a bunch of really big iPhones but then also two widgets on the lock screen that that is some real personality on a lock screen it's a welcome feature of course not only that you also be able to save multiple different lock screens with different wallpapers different clocks and different combinations of widgets and save those lock screens so then you can switch between those at any time it's like swapping watch faces on your watch but then you can also tie a lock screen to a focus mode so if you have your sleep Focus mode and you have your sleep home screen you now also have a sleep lock screen with your sleep widgets and your sleep clock and you can have your work lock screen and your do not disturb lock screen all those things will be synced when you change your focus mode they'll all have different wallpapers different clocks different widgets whatever you want that is personality that that is really nice music controls are also at the bottom now too instead of being this massive huge thing right under your clock in the middle oh and there's now live updating notifications too so you know how some apps will send you just a bunch of notifications as things update or as things change uh maybe a live score update for example since you want at the first quarter and at halftime well now there's a new feature called what is it called uh live activities but it's exactly what it sounds like now one notification can continually update with the latest information instead of having a bunch of notifications from that one app that is nice and I know a bunch of apps that could use that update so the lock screen is a big new thing in iOS 16 but then there's also a bunch of little features sprinkled within the rest of the os2 one of them in messages is you can now edit iMessage messages so that is going to be hilarious uh I kind of want to try to see if there's any sort of indicator next to the message that's been edited I'll play around with this in the beta I would say definitely get subscribed see the videos on these new softwares when I actually get to play with them and dive into them deep and make my feature reviews but yes you will be able to edit iMessages and you'll also be able to undo send and you can also Mark a thread as unread and yes I am a little bit salty that you can edit an iMessage before you can edit tweets assuming that doesn't happen by Fall there's also a couple new shareplay experiences to easily discover things you can watch together with someone and they dramatically improved on device dictation so you can move back and forth between voice and touch as you're typing something this feature looks really cool it actually looks very similar to what Google just did with the last version of the pixel which made the pixel the best voice to text phone on the planet and really changed the way I use it so I'm looking forward to seeing if this is as good as that uh but that's a welcome feature but then there's a couple other highlights do you remember a live text where you take a picture of a sign or any anything with text in it and you can always just highlight the text in that photo straight away well they're bringing that to videos so any video you take with text in it you'll be able to pause and live select and if that works well that's going to be I think incredible I mean I feel like that's lowkey unreal for students like you just record your whiteboard after a lecture and it just makes your notes more useful but then they took it another step further and they also showed a demo of touching and holding a subject of a photo and it lifts the subject into an object that you can copy and paste like text that that is that's amazing obviously it's pretty Next Level it kind of just takes all the work out of like tracing something out and making it like a Discord sticker or something we would have used in the past so that again I want to try it but that seems amazing and Apple Maps adds multi-op routing Apple news adds more live sports coverage they also overhaul the home app in a way that I would very much like Google to copy uh with their home app with the organization and filter toggles at the top and live camera views this is a really nice upgrade but then that's pretty much it for iOS again it's not you know some huge visual overhaul that's not what's happening with iOS updates anymore even though it did happen with Android but lots of you know neat features stacked on top of each other boom iOS update can we talk about carplay for a second so they had this statement on stage that apparently 79% of new car buyers would only consider a new car if it has carplay in it which I don't even know if that's accurate that seems a little high but I think the point that they're trying to make that I agree with is that most incar infotainment systems suck they've been bad for a long time and so just having Apple carplay in your car made the infotainment system much better and much more usable that's what people wanted and that was the old carplay today we got a sneak peek at the next generation of carplay coming out later this year which not only revamps the UI a bit but basically is now able to just take over a new car's entire software experience on every screen lots of new cars have screens instead of TS so the screen behind the steering wheel a screen to the side of the steering wheel and carplay will literally just be able to take them all over and be consistent across everything so this this is pretty sick I've always used carplay when I have the opportunity on a car that has it two things come to mind one why would anyone ever use the built-in infotainment system in a car if you have car play just doing everything and it seems like there's no motivation Now for car manufacturers to get really good at making that software it's just not going to be as good as carplay I don't know maybe that's a pessimistic view but two hey apple have you ever considered making the rest of the car I this is probably a totally new idea you've never heard before but you know you've made a bunch of the pieces of the software and using the car maybe the rest maybe like an electric it's probably never mind so okay when watch OS came up on the screen at the keynote as the next software they're going to talk about the first thing I thought was group challenges please let us do group fitness challenges if they don't do it now are they ever going to let us do it please add that feature so they added some other more granular information for tracking certain activities so now instead of just doing a running workout with just distance and elevation like they always do this will keep track of not just heart rate but heart rate zones and let you set up interval training if you want to do that type of stuff which I do that's super useful to me uh Triathlon workouts will now automatically be able to detect when you've switched from swimming to biking and to running so you don't have to do it for you for yourself cool but there's also some more information that will be tracked with sleep so it'll track your sleep stages so I do wear the watch to sleep and it does give me a very basic overview of what's happening but now it'll tell you all the same stuff basically Samsung's app has been telling me which is if you're in REM sleep or core sleep or light sleep or deep sleep cool but yeah no group challenges it never came up they talked about Fitness all the time and you can actually close your rings with just an iPhone now and no watch so they do want people closing their rings and feeling motivated by the Rings but yeah no uh no group challenges there's got to be a reason they haven't added it yet right but then we got to our first bit of hardware at WWDC which is the second generation of Apple silicon in the Mac the M2 Chip it is officially unveiled and we get to hear all about it now we knew the Apple silicon transition because they told us would take about 2 years right so the only computer that hasn't transitioned from Intel stuff to Apple silicon is the Mac Pro that'll probably happen sometime in the next few months we didn't get a teaser of it or anything but that's the last one but this M2 is basically just a second generation of the Baseline bottom end of the Apple silicon lineup so M1 Pro and M1 Ultra are still higher end chips than this but M2 is replacing M1 and it's interesting this is the first time they're going to be able to compare a new Mac chip TOs El to something that they've done in the past so it'll be interesting to see what type of performance gains to expect and there's some decent numbers so it's a new generation still 5 net chip with 20 billion transistors which is 25% more than M1 the unified memory bandwidth is now 100 GB per second which is 50% more than M1 it supports up to 24 gigs of unified memory which again is 50% more than M1 and CPU performance is generally about 20% higher while GPU performance is about 35% higher and the media engine gets a huge upgrade as well so while this is the lowest end chip in the lineup this is absolutely going to get some claimed performance improvements over the M1 I could do a whole separate video on the graphs and the performance stuff I might actually do that uh obviously that's down the road but you do need a new machine to put these new chips in and so we got that too actually we literally got two but the one that most people are going to care about is the new Macbook Air it's a new redesign it comes in four colors now and it's got a brand new refreshed look it's not a wedge shape anymore it's absolutely more flat and it's looking much more similar in Aesthetics to the other new Macbook Pros it's still extremely thin 11.3 mm thick and 2.7 lb and overall 20% less internal volume than the last MacBook Air uh but it gets a new mag Safe Port for charging on the left along with two Thunderbolt ports and on the right there's a high impedance audio jack the keyboard now has a full-size function row at the top with a touch ID button along with a new Quad speaker setup and new microphones but the biggest change is actually the display It's a larger 13.6 in screen in almost the same footprint as the last MacBook Air it gets brighter now up to 500 nits matching the M1 MacBook Pro but you can see it has a new Notch the aesthetic apple is slowly getting us used to with their new laptop form factor which includes a new 1080p webcam this is a large overall I think quite nice set of updates for the world's most popular laptop the new chip and all the new designs and things surrounding it um but definitely get subscribed I'm going to be making a full entire video on my more dedicated detailed thoughts and breaking down this new laptop and all the changes and what I think people will like about it and what I like about it including why I think the new midnight color might not actually be the best color to pick um but overall really good laptop maybe a little bit on the other end of the spectrum is the new M2 MacBook Pro also unveiled and I say that because that is basically the same exact machine as the M1 MacBook Pro but just with an M2 Chip inside it now that's it same exact thing and that's not a bad thing that's obviously already a very good laptop that I liked a lot but it just feel like it didn't get the same amount of love as the other new Macbook Pros so that was interesting to see so the new M2 MacBook Air starts at $1.99 so theice price does go up but they are keeping the M1 MacBook Air around which is a couple years old but they're keeping it at that $9.99 price so you can still get in to a MacBook Air at $9.99 and then the new M2 MacBook Pro is $12.99 I'll get more into this in the other video but I feel like there's not a whole lot of people that I would recommend the M2 MacBook Pro to you're giving up mag safe you're giving up the new display you're giving up the new speakers the new webcam the new fast charging all to just have slightly better sustained performance which you know you probably should end up getting a 14-in M1 pro at that point but again I'll get more into that in the other video but of course we were all wondering what the name of the software would be that they would run on these new Macs they do this whole big reveal for the software name every year and so the new version of Mac OS for 2022 Mac OS Ventura so they walked us through it Ventura again is not so much an aesthetic change as much as it's a bunch of useful features put together in one place you know a couple of the stock apps get better the mail app has better search features finally uh FaceTime handoff between devices is super dope you know get home you're on a FaceTime on your phone you want to switch to the computer one button shows up and it's a click away that's awesome but probably the most interesting feature that I'm definitely going to want to try is called continuity camera and as you can probably understand by the name that is literally just using the cameras on the back of the iPhone as your webcam so there's this optional Belin made mag safe Mount coming out later at some point this year and I'm sure tons of other companies are working on some version of this also but basically when it's enabled and your phone is stable your Mac will just see all the cameras on the back of your iPhone as webcam options basically admitting that yeah webcams usually suck so here's an actually good camera but the craziest part this is actually probably the one feature that actually really surprised me and blew me away on stage so it's facing you it's the webcam right it's got the ultrawide here as well it will see that ultrawide camera and because it's so wide and it's facing down in front of you it can actually take the edge of that frame to see what's in front of you cut it out flip it over stretch it and do some processing to give you a straight up top down view of what's on your desk it's called desk View and damn that is cool I want to try to see exactly how it's creating that angle like I really want to try this and see how close to the computer I can get with the phone that it'll actually see the keyboard board and everything in front of me but that is some impressive and clever processing happening right there well played Apple well played the Mac also got this feature called stage manager I found it kind of odd on the Mac but I think it'll make a little bit more sense in a second basically it's this side dock looking thing for your active windows and it keeps the app or apps that you're working on front and center so on stage it's basically acting like another set of window management tools um I'm personally probably going to stick with spaces the way I use that on the Mac already but this feature is also coming to iPad OS 16 so the iPad gets this so there were a lot of rumors you know people talking about the iPad is it finally going to get this overhaul to be more of a computer you know WWDC that would be the time to do it and this is kind of along those lines so the M1 iPads will now let you extend your display onto an external display instead of mirroring and then stage manager acts as a sort of window management system so for the first time on an iPad you can have overlapping windows and move them around like this and actually resize them and you can also pair things up move them off to the side and have a total of up to eight active windows open four on the iPad and four more on the external display all in the foreground that is definitely something to keep an eye on I I like the way the iPad sort of slowly evolves towards being a more capable computer it is frustratingly slow but I think that's something I'm gonna be giving a shot I'm G to dive into the betas get to know the features and actually tell you guys if they're worth knowing about and using or not but yeah that's about it for new software stuff that's iPad OS and that's that's dubdub oh wait one more thing sorry I almost forgot the iPad finally gets a weather app finally they did it they decided it was good enough you I don't know if I don't know if a calculator is happening anytime soon but Bravo weather so get subscribed to see the videos that I'm talking that are also upcoming also check out the link below I did a master class it's just been a long time coming that I actually am able to say that out loud um so if you want to you can sign up that window for signing up for it and everyone taking the class at once is now open super cool and you also get a link a discount if you sign up at the link below so that's also below that's all I got to say for this video stay tuned catch you guys in the next one peace [Music],"Great and better ❤ | Obviously a new animation makes the button more pressable 😂 | [risolto eja di gomma]

the only function I need if I have forgotten it ... I installed it yesterday October 25, I mixed Ventura on my Mac mini and there is no longer the automatic switch-off function, today called the apple and they also remotely guide me and they too agree that in fact there is ... we will have to wait ...

l'unica funzione che mi serve se la sono dimenticata... io ho installato ieri 25 ottobre ho insalato Ventura sul mio Mac mini e non c'è più la funzione spegnimento accensione automatica, chiamato oggi la apple e anche loro da remoto mi guidano e convengono anche loro che in effetti non c'è... si dovrà attendere... | where did they put the on-off function? os ventura... | oh wow,... And the God Damn Homebar that literally Sucks in every App is still here, I don´t know literally anyone who like this Crap of Useless Software | Im really liking this shift from apple controlling stuff to customization. | It's always a pleasure to sit back and laugh at iToddlers complaining about their overlords while knowing full well they will buy anything they push out to be part of the ""crowd."" 

BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH | Not having the group fitness challenges again is getting a little annoying... | What do you recommend? I’ve been a long time apple customer.  Watch phone iPad mac and speakers.  I actually have been thinking about switching to google or Samsung.  But I’m torn! | Apple boring"
MUU0BjJjAvk,The Future of Smartphone Cameras? Sony Xperia 1 IV!,Sony might be onto something here with the Xperia 1 IV... Sony Xperia 1 IV: https://amzn.to/3yUXeEv MKBHD Merch: http://shop.,2022-05-24T00:17:02Z,2831019,105017,4109,[Music] hey what's up mkbhd here so this is the back of the iphone 8. one camera then this is the back of the iphone 10. two cameras this is the iphone 13 pro three cameras this is the back of the galaxy s22 ultra four cameras and you better believe there are some phones out now with five cameras we've just gotten very used to the idea of smartphones having lots of cameras on the back it's even become a little bit of a status thing like when you see that phone with several cameras on the back you kind of know that that's one of the more premium ones so this sony phone may look like a bunch of the other ones that we've talked about and kind of just like a lot of other sony phones and it has all the sony stuff that we've come to expect over the years but it has one really key feature up its sleeve that makes it very different see there's other types of phones when they have three cameras for example they have three native focal lengths typically it's an ultra wide a standard and a telephoto so that's awesome if you just hit the 0.5 x button for an ultra wide or just hit the 3x button for that telephoto shot those are basically native optical zoom but everything in between is just going to be digitally zooming between them so if you zoom into 3.5x that's basically the same as you cropping in slightly to a photo from the 3x camera after you take it if you zoom in to 2.5x that's just zooming way into the 1x lens with digital zoom you're not getting more detail the photo won't necessarily look better it's just purely for convenience so that's why you notice that little snap that happens when you get to the 3x and it switches to the next camera that's how you can tell your photo will be better but this sony xperia 1 mark 4 brings back the legendary continuous optical zoom through this telephoto camera so last time we saw this was in this the asus zenfone zoom back in 2015 which was a much worse camera and that kind of fell on its face so the tech has come a long way since then so there's still a 1x camera yes there's still a 0.7 x for your ultra wide shots but the telephoto camera is now behaving kind of like a full-size zoom lens with a focal length range of 85 millimeters to 125 millimeters so now lets you smoothly zoom between 3.5 x and 5.2 x with real optical zoom and yes that means there are moving parts inside the phone to make this happen so sony's been working on this for a little while you might remember the xperia 1 mark iii that i also reviewed which is this one which also had a pretty wild telephoto camera set up this one with magnets snapped between 70 and 105 millimeters so that was technically variable optical zoom which is still super cool it's like having two cameras in one in that telephoto camera this one with continuous zoom is like having dozens of different focal lengths and dozens of cameras in one just in that telephoto now any focal length between 85 and 125 millimeters will be perfectly native optical zoom but again it's more like having a real continuous zoom built into the back of a phone now in practice you can see here the zoom range is relatively small 3.5 x to 5.2 x is not a huge zoom but it does actually achieve its goal this was the xperia one mark iii at 70 millimeters then snapped to 105 millimeters both of these are optical then this was when it was right in between so just digital zoom now this is the xperia 1 mark iv first at 85 millimeters then all the way in at 125 millimeters and then here it is right in between it's subtle but it maintains better sharpness throughout this whole range while behaving just like a regular camera and that is why i think this is or at least logically should be the future of smartphone cameras we've been trying to get good variables different focal lengths on the back of smartphone cameras for a while now like i said we've just accepted a bunch of different cameras on the back so galaxy s 22 ultra right now what does that have that has a regular camera an ultra wide a 3x telephoto and a 10x telephoto so that it can balance between a variety of different focal lengths of course 3x will be perfectly optical and then 10x will sharpen again but again it's still going to be a little bit blurry in between that's why this is ideal this is literal perfect optical zoom throughout the whole range you just can't beat physics now of course the tech has a lot to improve on probably the most obvious piece being it's got to cover a wider and wider focal range as it gets better like i said 3.5 x to 5.2 x turns out isn't a whole lot of zoom right now but imagine a version that goes all the way from 2x to 8x and then maybe something does all the way from 1x to 10x you know suddenly you don't need a separate primary and telephoto camera anymore and so i was just kind of logically extrapolating it seems like it would be such a cool idea if we went from one camera on the back to two to three and then as the tech gets better and better we go from three back to two and then back to one but but the more i think about it i don't actually think that we can expect to reduce all of the cameras on the back of the phones now all down to one just because the physics problem is incredibly hard like if you look at a mirrorless camera you have one sensor but you still need to change lenses to go from ultra wide to a normal field of view to a telephoto even if they all can zoom you really don't see often some casual lens that can do everything like an 18 to 400 millimeter lens actually i take that back i just looked it up there there are some that exist i just found on b h there is an 8 to 800 millimeter lens but it's the size of like a microwave it's 53 pounds and costs 165 000 and that is the point here this is a physics problem basically and all of the pain points of trying to solve that problem get magnified when you shrink it all down into like a tiny smartphone camera like this with these little itty bitty sensors that don't gather that much light and where there's not a lot of room for high quality optics but high quality optics really is the key here so that zenfone zoom that we talked about earlier that phone had a single camera that did 28 to 84 millimeters so it's about 1x to 3x zoom and i never owned that camera or that phone but from all the reviews i read they all killed it for having really poor quality optics and really bad images as a result and so that means the technology has definitely gotten significantly better since then and hopefully that trend can continue so i love that sony is working on this they stay really clever with it obviously starting with turning everything sideways within the phone for the periscope zoom and then using magnets to move around the optical elements inside in a super precise way that is very impressive what they've achieved so far so file this down as yet another sony phone with a super impressive technically well executed enthusiast feature and then the rest of the phone built around it is exactly what you'd expect from sony it's an upgrade from the xperia one mark iii that i reviewed less than a year ago it's the same tall matte black shape and design you can barely tell the difference from the outside between the phones but they do have some year-over-year upgrades thrown in they've still got their incredibly overkill six and a half inch 4k 120 hertz oled display but this one's even brighter up to a thousand nits so it's more visible outdoors and even more of a battery hog uh the battery though is also bigger it's up to 5000 milliamp hours now and they've bumped it up to a snapdragon 8 gen 1 chip with 12 gigs of ram half a terabyte of storage there's updated loudspeakers and a new 12 megapixel selfie camera all three cameras on the back can shoot 4k 120 frames per second videos and 20 photos per second in bursts with sony's awesome eye tracking autofocus and hey i gotta hand it to sony i was gonna say i think they're the only smartphone brand that's never had a notch in any of their phones but i did look it up there was actually once a sony phone that had a notch and it was pretty brutal but they've been remarkably consistent with this design they're also one of the only ones keeping a headphone jack around despite being one of the companies selling tons of wireless earbuds too so they've added a bunch of new software features around this phone centered around gaming and live streaming but at the same time with all those pluses there are definitely also still some classic sony downsides first starting with the fact that it's being unveiled now but isn't coming to the u.s till september so you can sort of map out the hype curve dropping between now and then and they very much still lean into the enthusiasts sony alpha camera-like shooting experience which is an upside for some people but that also means there is no simple point-and-shoot portrait mode or night mode and you do have to dive straight into sony's camera app which obviously isn't for everybody also fun fact the box it comes in uh just has a phone yeah just the phone no charging brick also no usbc cable no paperwork just the phone that's it and it's going to retail when it does land in the u.s for 1 599 so yeah not for everybody but hey i got to give sony props because this this is one of those things like i really enjoy using these sony phones the software experience on them has kind of quietly become one of my favorite near stock android experiences on any android phone they get their updates they're smooth all the time and they consistently deliver some innovative new stuff in every new phone they drop and they refuse to be notched or headphone jack dropping like kind of the rest of the phones out so i'm glad it exists all right that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace [Music],"Thanks for the review brother! You gave me a good insight in buying it ❤ | Best tech reviewer on the web. Hands down. | I'm watching on a Sony Xperia L4 with the notch lol | cool | Samsung K Zoom was the first phone camera that looks like a compact camera :) | Just observing something here. People don't seem to engage or discuss anything in the comments after the initial hype wave has passed. Tech is rendered irrelevant the next day after the review. I just bought this phone and I'm in love. But man. Dead in here a year later. Does anybody still use this phone over the other 2 that have come out after it? | after watching price i thought to pause video :( | I hate it when I can't find such phone in Ghana to buy. How do I get one to buy | This phone is not for everyone but certainly for anyone who just wanted a simpler design. I don't hate iPhone or Samsung nowadays, but I have to say Sony is in different world and I love that. | Ideally they need to make one which covers ultra wide to portrait (0.7-2.5x).
This is what most people use and would eliminate the need for any additional cameras.
Maybe pair it with one of their fancy high res sensors for decent quality digital 2.5-5x zoom.
5 and 10 x High zoom cameras are marketing hype and aren't used that often.
I'd rather see the money go in to a better overall camera."
yCBEumeXY4A,DALLE: AI Made This Thumbnail!,DALL-E 2 is an AI that can draw anything you ask it for. It's terrifying and amazing at the same time. Tim vs DALL-E: ...,2022-05-16T22:48:57Z,2712038,141806,6070,what if i told you there is a system right now that can take natural language input so whatever description you want just make something up and it will take that text and turn it into a surprisingly realistic image of exactly what you described so you type an astronaut riding a horse and it spits out a brand new image of an astronaut riding a horse you type teddy bears shopping for groceries and boom there's an image of teddy bear shopping for groceries you type a bowl of soup that is a portal to another dimension and boom my god it's a bowl of soup that's a portal to another dimension and it's not just one it actually spits out 10 different versions across a spectrum of variation in any art style you want you name it and it can draw it so what is happening here how does it work and what happens if i try so first things first yes this does exist this is a real thing it's called dolly 2 and it's an ai research project by a company called openai one of many elon musk co-founded companies at this point and so the purpose of this ai specifically is to create original realistic images and art from a text description this is aditya ramesh a researcher and co-creator of dolly one and dolly two he's easily the most qualified person to explain what's happening here um so the way w1 generates images dolly one generates an image starting from the top left and moving industrial order row viral so diffusion works completely differently the way diffusion works is we train a model to reverse a corruption process that's applied to clean images so it's kind of hard to wrap your head around but basically there's two main ai technologies behind dolly two they're called clip and diffusion so clip is the part that's matching images to text and basically uses that match to train the computer to understand concepts in images so it can generate new images of the same concepts so when i asked it for an astronaut riding a horse for example it's not just making a mosaic of images it found online it knows the idea of what an astronaut is it knows what the concept of writing means it knows what a horse is and maybe most impressively it knows what's an aesthetically pleasing image to humans so then it can create a completely new visual version of this idea that hasn't existed before now clip doesn't really have the ability to do the pretty high resolution images all by itself it's just more generating the gist of an image based on those concepts so that is where diffusion comes in so diffusion is super impressive basically by teaching a computer to corrupt an image by adding gaussian noise it can then learn to uncorrupt or enhance an image by removing that noise it's kind of like step one draw the circle step two draw the rest of the owl so i don't know if you've ever seen this website called this person does not exist.com but if you haven't you should check it out it shows you a surprisingly realistic image of a face but as you might have guessed this person does not exist it's not a real face it's actually using ai to look at thousands of faces and then generate a new face with that information that is shockingly realistic but it turns out is not a real human so dolly dolly 2 is like a way more advanced generalized version of that for anything so when you open it up it's literally just a blank search text box where you can type in whatever you want to create now of course as you can probably imagine with all these concerns and possibilities this isn't just a tool that's available to the public it's not like anyone can use it openai has kept this mostly behind closed doors to a very small hand-selected group of people but for a day they gave me the keys and i was able to generate whatever i want which of course means i had to ask it to finally reveal to us what the long-awaited apple car would look like i mean this is an opportunity unlike any other so i typed it in i waited my 10 seconds with great breath and then the secret was finally unveiled oh right of course i don't know why i expected anything different but for real okay so the open ai team was kind enough to allow me to feed dolly 2 whatever i want so i decided to start pretty simple and then get a little bit more complex as we go so a blue apple and a bowl of oranges so okay these are good these are actually i mean that was extremely easy but the sharpness the realism the lighting even to just create these brand new out of nothing there is so much detail in this one it's kind of hard to believe it isn't real okay an elderly kangaroo i mean i don't know what i expected specifically an elderly kangaroo to look like i guess maybe i pictured gray hair or something but i buy it i mean the fact that it's again it's not a real photo but it looks like a real photo of an elderly kangaroo that is very impressive a wise elephant staring at the moon at night whoa okay so that is definitely a wise elephant he or she is in fact staring at the moon and it is definitely at night it's not bad the moon does look a little bit wonky if you if you look a little bit closer on some of these it's not perfect but the elephant is very real looking okay let's get a little more specific here a teddy bear doing surgery on a grape in the style of a 1990s cartoon oh my god look at these cartoons sometimes it misses totally understandable also it seems to have chosen scissors instead of maybe a more realistic actual surgery i'll get to why in a minute but the facial expressions the feet and everything i mean that is a teddy bear doing surgery on a grape all right this one's from mac the studio dog a cooker hunch i'm pronouncing that wrong using a camera on a movie set wow that is okay if you couldn't already tell that is the name of the dog breed and the closer you inspect each individual image the more the photo realism part kind of falls apart which maybe isn't shocking because this is kind of a crazy thing to have a picture of but the detail in the dog breed and it actually using the camera in the pictures is crazy good i wonder if we could post that to mac's instagram if anybody would notice that it's not a real picture i'd probably figure it out all right a robot woman guarding a wall of computers wow okay so so many interesting details and decisions being made in these images so the word guarding implies a bit of a pose and there's a couple different guarding poses here but that's cool the computers for the most part are also pretty convincing if you don't zoom in too much and also it's interesting that none of the walls of computers go all the way up to the ceiling either which is cool but that is definitely a robot woman guarding that wall of computers alright what if we go a tiger discovering the lost city of atlantis wow okay these are more of an art style probably because one there won't be any like photo realistic reference images of the lost city of atlantis so i imagine it'll look better this way and two this is a crazy image to create so with each of these they're great without zooming in and pixel peeping and they very much accomplish the goal of illustrating a tiger discovering atlantis like i asked the crazy part here though to me is how much imagination it's using like i'm actually getting more than what i asked for the facial expressions poses orientation of things reflections even the accurate lighting in shadows is crazy like i asked for a tiger discovering atlantis here but it's decided to add trees and birds and a moon all by itself all right here we go here we go a painting inspired by the mona lisa of a goat taking pictures with an ipad i this is my new favorite thing you you can really just go off the rails with complexity and it just gets them right almost all of these goats have hands too which is hilarious but the drawings themselves have actually also stayed true to the theme it's a painting in the style of the mona lisa and the tablets are all you know varying levels of convincing ipads wow i'm going to put these all on twitter by the way in like one big thread plus a few extras if they don't make it into the video so definitely hit the link below if you want to see those but last but not least a cyclops riding a tractor listening to airpods in the style of the simpsons i mean come on maybe it's not a perfect cyclops and it is interesting that it's chosen over the ear headphones for all of the headphones and not you know airpod earbuds but i feel like there's nothing this can't do this is one of those ai tools that's so good that it almost brings up more questions than it answers like why does a tool like this even exist in the first place well dolly 2 is a research project not a customer product and open ai's goal is to create good safe general ai which is really hard like there are a lot of really really good task specific ai systems that'll do things from like detecting cancer in x-rays to self-driving cars that navigate the streets or just sharpening photos in photoshop but the whole general ai thing which needs a ton of information to be able to navigate a ton of different situations is a whole other challenge i mean if you think like tesla robot walking around the earth completing tasks for you like that's the level we're talking about here and so being able to recognize objects and images and associate them very quickly and accurately is a big part of that now are there things that dolly doesn't do well yes actually there are both some intentional and some unintentional shortcomings of dolly 2 as it exists right now so on the intended side uh the library of images that dolly references is massive but it doesn't have any images of adult content or illegal activity or violence so it doesn't create images with that stuff in it makes sense that's probably why we got scissors in the teddy bear's hand instead of a knife because that's the next closest association the ai was able to make for that surgery and you also can't ask for imagery of specific identities of people so you can ask for man robbing a bank but you can't ask for marquez brownlee robbing a bank as curious as i am about what type of image that would spit out you can't that would be dangerous for obvious reasons but also dolly 2 is known to have some quirks so one of them is it doesn't do very well specifically with variable binding or what basically will happen when you ask for relative position of objects in an image so if i ask for a red cube on top of a blue cube it might just give you a blue cube on top of a red cube and we actually saw this in one of the images i got back for a blue apple and a bowl of oranges well right there that's clearly an orange in a bowl of blue apples which is kind of funny and it also for whatever reason doesn't do written text well so sometimes it can give you certain letters but if you ask it for like a sign that says a certain word it'll almost never actually give you that there's actually a pretty hilarious twitter thread of someone asking dolly for signs with certain things over and over again just to see what random text it spits out which is also pretty funny but this is the type of stuff that i'll be working on for dolly 3 and for future versions as you can imagine but it's funny with every shortcoming they found there was also an equally awesome accidental upside they discovered too like this diffusion method can also transform images so you can take an existing image and run the model over and over to push it more and more towards any prompt you want so you can take this plain jacket for example and slowly turn it into a jackson pollock painting or take this picture of a cat and slowly turn it into a samurai master or take a picture of tech a piece of tech and slowly un-modernize it over and over like look what it does to this iphone it turns it back into an older and older phone it's modifying existing images based on other existing concepts it's it's kind of sick so is this going to be taking people's jobs well lucky for you if you want the exact answer to that question that's literally the concept we attacked with the new studio video so i'll link it below the like button if you want to watch it but we pit dolly 2 up against tim who is the graphic designer here at the mkbhd studio where their jobs are kind of basically the same thing it's to turn the words coming out of my mouth into a good-looking image spoiler alert if you give tim enough time he'll make something better but in 10 seconds dolly is able to spit out a bunch of different variations and while the images might be a bit fuzzy around the edges or have weird text or fall apart when you zoom in on faces or hands or objects this tool as presently constructed is amazing for brainstorming ideas and concepts and things that would normally take much longer to create is truly an amazing side effect of the development of this ai that it's able to make this tool where the images that it spits out aren't necessarily supposed to be finished final pieces of work but they are a great starting point for making stuff later that's actually exactly what we did with this video's thumbnail which started off as an image generated by dolly where it was told to make a robot hand drawing so i have no doubt that there will be versions of dolly in the future that make even higher resolution and more photorealistic images and then even better like quick animations and then video clips and then whole movies even all on our way to this general ai goal that we're working towards what a time to be alive thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace,"What a time to be alive! | When this video first released, I was genuinely mindblown.

Now AI as a whole is only getting better, and AI images and videos are getting annoying and very sloppy | I recommend watching this in 2025 | 4:23 lmao | today this is just part of life | this is where it started. | Imaging seeing this in 2024 | This is how it all started 😅 | This is the video that put AI on mine and so many other peoples' radars 2 years ago | Ok the minute I heard Elon Musk's name I wanted to puke ."

...",2022-05-12T16:01:05Z,6169116,186310,7568,[Music] hey what's up mbhd here okay so for the past few years Sony's Flagship noise cancelling headphones have been the King of the Hill of course they've made some minor adjustments and feature additions over the past few so by the time they got to The Mark iiiii with their comfort and noise cancelling and USB type-c they were the top of the market and then the markv added Multi-Device support but they've essentially looked the same sounded excellent and they've been an easy recommendation as a result but these new Mark 5 on the other hand are a real departure from that formula a lot of the changes I do really like but there is one big one that I definitely don't so the first thing you might be wondering is is there actually a sound Improvement but I actually want to just start with the new design cuz you can see that they have this new shape that is this pretty minimal sharp and clean look there is still a dark and a light this light is a sort of a cream colored version and there's a lot of good things about this design the ear cups are slightly bigger and wider the new vegan leather material is so much softer it is it's kind of amazing it combines that with the super lightweight of the whole headphones to make this entire pair more comfortable to wear for long periods of time honestly I'm just going to say this is the most comfortable pair of noise cancelling headphones I've ever tried you still have a touch sensitive panel on the right side ear cup for skipping pausing Etc they actually still have onoff head detection despite not having a plastic cutout in the ear cup like the last one and there's now twice as many many slots for microphones around the outside it goes from four total to four on each side eight total microphones and I'll get into what that does for noise cancellation and voice quality in a second but you can see they're fairly minimal and hidden well in this new design but overall overall I actually still feel like this design is a downgrade for one main reason so what do you get noise cancelling headphones for right travel you're getting them to travel and so these old versions were the King of the Hill because they were obviously super comfortable had great noise cancellation and lots of features and good sound quality but they also folded up like this and fit into uh their little case just like that toss that in a bag and you're good to go this new version with this new design does not fold at all so with this new sliding headband design which is kind of like the Bose 700's and the airpods Max and so many others that's the only way of adjusting the size of the headphones so they no longer fold down into a smaller size and so as a result the case you carry them around in is quite a bit bigger uh it's kind of a cool case it looks like a modern backpack without the straps and it's got some angular origami type seams and folds along the sides and once you get inside there's a magnetic door over a compartment that holds your charging cable and an audio cable if you need one this is a great case it's basically exactly like the Bose 700's but yeah now it's just huge with bow though we saw them do this new design with the 700s but they at least kept around the quiet Comfort Series so the QC 45s still fold down like they always did and the airpods Mac are notoriously annoying to travel with even though I still try to make it work but these are wh1000 Mark 5 which on paper makes it the sequel to The markv so that's a little bit dangerous but I do know that they're keeping around the marvs these new Mark 5ivs are going to retail for $400 and they're going to keep around the marvs for $ 350 although you can already find them for like $ 329 or300 so these are starting to look kind of like a deal but let's just get past that design flaw they're still premium lightweight comfortable noise cancelling headphones and they have yet again bumped up the noise cancellation capabilities pretty significantly so I've been saying for years they're the King of the Hill for travel because as far as white noise is concerned like airplane engine road noise all that sort of stuff they do an A+ job at canceling that right when I put these on I immediately noticed it's even stronger it still crushes that droning low end but now some of the more higher frequencies are better canel out too appliances Wier stuff human voices too so yeah the last Sony's did have worldclass noise cancellation but these get even better and we can thank the extra microphones and processor for that now with any noise cancelling headphones and all those mics you also have a transparent mode these have it again and they have 20 levels of adjustment in the app of how much transparency gets through they're really good they are definitely better than the bows but the airpods max are still on a completely different level as far as transparency mode those are the best I've ever heard in any headphones it sounds like you're not wearing headphones you just hear everyone's voices and everything perfectly clearly and these just don't get that good like these just sound like a somewhat muffled version of reality uh especially with voices and the higher frequency stuff even though there is actually a specific enhanced voices toggle it just doesn't quite reach the airpods level as far as hearing your own voice but then for actual musical sound quality they are very similar to last year which is to say excellent and they do have a new 30mm carbon fiber driver and there is still ldac support if you have the right combination of smartphone and music Source but I think I can safely say if I have an Android phone the these to me are among the absolute best sounding noise cancelling wireless headphones available again they don't sound as good they're not as full and crisp and balanced as airpods Max paired with an iPhone but obviously that's just for iPhone users that have $550 to burn but yeah there's just something about really good noise cancelling headphones that feels like magic like I can be in a crowded area where my eyes tell me this is a loud area but to hear absolutely silence behind a perfectly isolated Baseline and he every detail of a vocal of some song like I'm in a live recording session is so sick that's what makes these headphones so good there were some rumors about the battery life getting bumped from 30 to 40 hours which would have been crazy but that's not what happened they are rated for the same 30 hours of battery life as the mark 4S and from my experience so far they've right about matched it uh so 40 like would have been nice and amazing but I still think 30 and the use I've gotten out of these is still very good the one improvement though uh is the charging faster charging so you can plug these in for 3 minutes and get 3 hours of listening out of it so if you just need to plug in real quick before you go head off to some trip somewhere that's very convenient again it's a travel feature but that's what that's what I want to break this all back down to at the end of the day these are travel headphones and they no longer fold which means they are everything about them is bigger and and more difficult to travel with than the last ones oh and also this this might be minor but I do have to mention it so if you're wearing the mark 4S like this and you didn't want to like do the hold to speak or listen to people and you just want to take them off real quick you can do that and then fold them down so they're just facing down and you can do other stuff and they'll just sit here the Mark fivs if you wear them correctly which is right side left side they don't fold down flat they actually only fold up and that's I'm definitely nitpicking like that's a small small thing but for $400 that's another thing that's not in the new headphones that was nicer about the old ones so if you're actually thinking about getting these headphones this is here this is a pretty nuanced recommendation but if you are using an Android phone and your bag is big enough and you plan on using these for travel listening to music phone calls if you're working with these all that sort of thing these are going to be amazing you get the Sony app you've got all the customization in the world you want to do ldac listening even they sound like very good headphones and they work really well so comfortable love these headphones but if you're really anyone else I'm going to bring back the marvs again for this I really think you should consider the marvs of course right because number one they're going to cost much less they number two actually fold down so if you want them to take up less space in your bag but they're also like 90% of these headphones they sound just about as good um they might not be as trendy or or premium looking as the new design but like you're going to get the same Comfort the same battery life really the only thing you're missing out on is the slightly faster charging and what those extra mics and processor get you for noise cancellation oh wait there's extra mics so maybe voice quality too all right so this is an audio test of the Sony wh1000 XM 4S still a bad name uh Sony uh water bottles available at mbc.com just so you know also there's some voices in the background there's some various noises but this is it it's okay it's okay for a mic and so now this is the audio quality for the w1000x m5s I think it sounds better it definitely isolates The Voice a little bit better against the same level of background noise but again the bar was pretty low for wireless headphones this is just generally good for calls for work for Stuff where you need a mic built into the headphones all right so my theory is Sony saw what Bose did with the 700 headphones with this new sliding design the magnet in the case and they said all right we can do that too and we'll do our own version of it and so they did an even bigger version of the same thing sliding design magnet in the case and everything and I'm slightly annoyed by the much bigger footprint here but I mean let's be real these are really good really comfortable premium noise cancelling headphones for 400 bucks with a terrible name as we'd expect from Sony but that's about what we'd expect it's good all right that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace,"Found them on FB marketplace for 200 should I cop? | Why are XM5’s so highly rated for their noise cancelling? Fantastic Google assistant integration, good sound quality, amazing transparency mode, but the noise cancelling is TERRIBLE. I've compared it with multiple friends that own the XM4s and they all agree that the noice cancelling is worse on the XM5s. It's just so subtle and you can still hear outside noises compared to say they noise cancelling in my soundcore liberty 3 pros that cost like a quarter of the price.

Got grok to quickly scan reddit and X discourse on the subject, options vary but I'm not alone, and people agree that the liberty 3 pros are much better. 

They are in ears though, but maybe coming from the liberty 3 pros which seal out the sound as they're in ears, my expectations have been skewed and I'm missing the point here 🤷🏾‍♂️ | just got myself on of these after using my HD25 for 15 years. i mean i think its ok to upgrade after such a long time but i really hope i dont have to upgrade until at least MX10 comes out. by the way two years in and you can find them for about 180$ used but almost unused. so thats a pretty good deal. | For me i like this all a lot because its very light and its very good for music its a complete package for the travel headphone. | Xm4 the worse sounding headphones i ever used | I just call them Mark 4 or Mark 5 😂 | dont mind that they dont fold. but the fact i cant turn the ear cups inwards is genuinely a deal breaker for me. hope they fix it in the xm6's (and that i can afford them) | Am i crazy? I have the Xm5s and the sound is trash? The bass has no rumble or thump. Kickdrums sound like rapping knuckles on a table. The treble and mids are artificial sounding and get tinny in places. Some songs are really good but others are just meh. For the price, I'm so upset with these headphones because the sound quality has been hyped so much. What am i missing? | I bought these today for like $250 from Adorama - Thanks to IGN's article for informing me about this deal! | I boughrt the M5 ...
I do not like that when you connect to bluetooth you do not get a voice to say it is connected.
Same for connecting to noise cancelling ... just a sound.....
Where when you check battery .. there IS a voice...

The noise canceeling is insane tho.
i also REALLY  LIKE the function where you hold all fingers on earcup... and noise cancelling is cancelled so you can talk/hear... and enables auto again when fingers are released.
Also the speech to chat option.... GREAT.

Sound is great.....but i still use FX sound to improve sound on pc."
U3DNz5asasA,"Pixel Watch, Pixel 7 and Google&#39;s Hardware Reveal 2022!",Google went ahead and went on a rampage of unveiling new hardware today at I/O. This is everything you need to know!,2022-05-11T18:55:06Z,2704559,103641,5910,all right what's up MKBHD here and today was Google's IO their annual developer conference and usually we don't see a ton of hardware at events like this but this one for whatever reason we got a ton of Hardware or at least Hardware announcements so there's kind of three levels of announcements going on here so first of all there's the right around the corner coming up next stuff that's two things and they're going to be going on sale in the next month or so then there's the later this year section so we did get a bit of a sneak preview at some more fall Hardware some stuff that we're actually going to get fully unveiled later this year and then there's the on the horizon section which is they went ahead and pre-announced a piece of 2023 hardware for some reason but we'll get to that but first of all in the next up section pixel 6A and pixel buds Pro these are both things that we kind of knew were coming but now we're finally getting all the details of these announcements so for the pixel 6A it is essentially a slightly smaller slightly bumped down pixel 6 and it will retail for 449 so honestly from what we can tell here the 6A will be very similar to the pixel 6 you can see the design same camera bar same glass same software with all the material you and live captions and speech recognition and camera features and it's powered by the same exact tensor chip from the flagship pixel 6 and 6 Pro but you know those phones are going on past 6 months old now so you can imagine the price of manufacturing some of those parts is starting to go down but the real main difference between the pixel 6A and the pixel 6 which is 599 is the display and cameras which is really interesting so for the display it is smaller a little bit the more premium pixels are both pretty big this will have a 6.1 in 1080P 60 HZ goed display which is still big but it's now the smallest pixel so then cameras are the other interesting thing so now Google telling us that cameras are one of the areas where they saved cost from the pixel 6 means that yeah okay this a is going to have cheaper cameras than the pixel 6 which worried me at first so it is still a standard and an ultrawide and you can kind of see a slightly new visual design in the camera bar which I'll touch on more in a second but on the spec sheet it actually tells us it is the Sony IMX 363 that's the sensor for the main camera which is actually the same 12 megapixel sensor that we've seen in some of those older pixels pixel 4 pixel 3 pixel 2 this is a tried and true older sensor so cheaper yes but also probably not bad but other things like materials and Battery appear to be about the same although do definitely have to test that stuff I I would suggest getting subscribed to see that review video when it comes out here battery could be an interesting one because this is the smallest lowest refresh rate display in any pixel but it still has the same tensor chip so we'll see how that gets handled could be amazing but the other specs I can confirm are 6 gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of storage IP67 water resistance it does have an indisplay fingerprint reader there's a 4400 mAh battery with 18 watt charging but there is no mention of wireless charging and then sub6 5G and millimeter W 5G with specific models and 5 years of Android security updates so that's the pixel 6A and that's the new budget smartphone but it's launching alongside a new high-end set of earbuds from Google pixelbuds pro so if we have pixelbuds a series I looked on Google store that's actually the only one they're selling right now so the a series for 100 bucks is like regular airpods basically and then pixel buds Pro for 200 bucks would be sort of equivalent to airpods Pro so this is a $199 noise cancelling pair of wireless earbuds they do have a transparency mode they'll have Multi-Device connectivity compatible with Android iOS and computers Google Assistant built in they have ipx4 sweat resistance and overall the design I'm going to say it looks pretty tame you know you can see the mics each earbud has three microphones you got the Silicon tips in front of an 11 mm driver and the case looks basically the same as the original pixel buds with the black and white design and the magnet and wireless charging the quoted battery life is 11 hours of listening or 7 hours with active noise cancellation ter turned on basically I feel like the differentiating factor with these especially when we get them and and listen to how they sound is going to come from the six Core Audio chip on board which also apparently will have a lot to do with the noise cancellation the transparency mode and just overall the way they sound now I've been waiting a long time for a pair of earbuds with noise cancellation and a transparency mode that Rivals airpods airpods still to this day have Far and Away the best transparency mode I've ever heard in any pair of headphones so I'm looking forward to maybe pixel buds stepping their game up in that Dimension it's just one part of headphones um but yeah the competition has a lot of other things going for him so we'll see how the pixelbuds stack up but yeah that's what's up next that's the stuff that'll be on sale this summer but then Google went ahead and gave us a little bit of a preview of some stuff that's coming up this fall including a full design reveal of the pixel 7 and 7 Pro and a new pixel watch finally so this is our limited first first look at the pixel 7 and 7 Pro so the details of course are way more confined with this stuff but you can see the new colors here and you can also see a bit more of that camera design and super bold big camera circles in the camera bar and in extra detail is we also know that that glass is soft touch which I am very excited about so it's sort of gone back and forth on soft touch but if you remember the pixel 3's with the soft touch glass I remember I really liked that back of a phone finish if it's anything like like that I'm very excited about it and seeing as there is a black 7 Pro at the bottom I'm thinking that's probably going to end up being the one I prefer although Matt white typically does a great job hiding fingerprints so we'll see this phone will have the Next Generation tensor chip and it will launch with Android 13 but that's pretty much all we know at this point so yeah new phone coming out this fall pixel 7 and 7 Pro new chip new colors new matte finish and and yeah I guess we can also technically see it still has a port at the bottom and it definitely has speakers all the classic stuff some new colors I'm not sure how I feel about this gray with the green undertone but it does contrast well with the gold but probably the more interesting preview we got is the one of the new pixel watch they're finally doing it this fall we're going to have I mean theoretically maybe a competitor to the Apple watch but sort of in the Android world I've been waiting for this for a long time it's a sort of a result of their collaboration or I guess purchase of Fitbit and this is it this is the pixel watch so okay it's a circular stainless steel design and it is a very simple silhouette as you can see not a whole lot to set it apart on the outside but I do like that it is simple and it has what they're calling a tactile crown for input though it's also a touchcreen and it has interchangeable bands and it runs were OS this is the pixel watch that we've been I mean hearing so much about for so long and waiting for it's clearly got some solid bezels all the way around I mean that's the first thing I noticed when the screen is on and I guess I'm judging just by eyeballing these lifestyle photos but it looks like it's about the same size as the smaller Apple watch I'm thinking maybe around 40 mm there isn't any mention of two different sizes like a small and a large I think it would make sense but they didn't say but basically that's all we really know know about the new pixel watch again this is something that we're going to get way more details on when it actually does get fully unveiled in October whenever their event is but there are a bunch of things that I'm also hoping for like I'm hoping it has a bright efficient crispy OLED display you know this UI they're showing has a lot of black and the black bezel clearly goes all the way around so I'm hoping that it's an OLED so it can sort of seamlessly blend into the bezel instead of being really obvious and ugly like a cheaper LCD I'm also of course hoping for good battery life at least a full day and if it's going to be a premium price I'm also hoping it has things like good haptics and good performance these animations of the UI showing smart home controls and checking notifications like it's cool but again I definitely want to play with it myself one thing to note though is this is basically going to act like a Fitbit like it seems like most of the the fitness tracking and sleep tracking and stuff like that you need the Fitbit app to work for so so it's going to act just like a Fitbit in that way and then were OSS is going to work the way you typically expect it to paired with an Android phone and then they've said there will be a cellular option so the watch can work without the phone and it'll do activity and sleep tracking and stuff like that through Fitbit and also it appears this will just be working specifically with Android phones probably best with the pixel but with Android phones and not the iPhone because in classic apple fashion lots of the stuff that the Apple watch can do no other smartwatch has access to so this this is very much an Android Smartwatch so yeah stay tuned for more details on that later but yeah then last but not least this was the announcement we got basically zero information on but Google did officially say that they're going to be dropping a pixel tablet in 2023 that's what they've told us that that's kind of all we know like we don't know any of the specs we don't know what time of year it'll come out we don't know what it'll even really be called technically we do know it will be on the larger side and on the pre prum side so I'm thinking like iPad Air to iPad Pro type price range and equivalent but feels like they're not really committing to anything else yet as far as the tablet goes I guess visually basically we just have this shot of the pixel portfolio where we can see that there is a tablet and it'll definitely have a camera and speakers and presumably a screen on the other side but yeah that's it it's really interesting that they're deciding to show off some of this stuff so early it kind of reminds me on one hand of of Sony who will announce a phone early in the year and then 6 months later it'll finally come out and all the hype is gone and everybody forgot about it but on the other hand this is Google we're talking about and they've always been leaking things constantly I mean they try to get ahead of the leaks this feels like them just going hey you know what instead of the phone leaking for the next 6 months we'll just tell people about it and take advantage of that because otherwise you just lose the hype and your own messaging so yeah let me know what you think is the most exciting or what you're looking forward to the most of this new Google stuff I'm definitely interested in in the watch actually I want to see what that's like on the wrist and to actually use but let me know in the comments section below we'll talk about it but yeah that's been it thanks for watching also random shout out but the iPod was officially discontinued this week probably one of the products everyone watching this video has at some point owned some version of so rip press F in the in the chat to pay your respects all right catch you guys in the next One Peace,"Update: Google has

ZQ4E0JJcxz0,What Happens When the iPhone Peaks?,"Are we at peak smartphone, or it just a hiccup from the chip shortage? The MKBHD Plugin: https://mvfx.co/mkbhd-sm MKBHD ...",2022-04-30T02:36:09Z,4289140,157174,10057,[Music] all right so truth is there really is only one spec of the iphone 14 that i find really interesting right now but first a question are we at peak smartphone i mean at this point it's a classic question and the gut reaction is usually yes feels like we are but i've always said no we are not at peak smartphone just as long as things are objectively getting better every single year just getting slightly better over and over again we keep getting more processing power more memory higher resolutions and more intelligence and we keep getting new features recently there's cameras underneath displays and fingerprint readers underneath screens that are getting better and just recently we started getting phones folding in half so if we are defining peak smartphone as having reached the apex where phones are no longer getting better and it's flat then amazingly we're still not there yet but i think we all have the same feeling which is clearly they have slowed down a lot since the beginning the 2007's and 2009's early smartphones were making huge leaps you know i got the first hd screen and then the first selfie camera and then the first 8k video now we're getting little things it slowed down so now it's the middle of 2022 and the iphone 13 is eight months old which means there's already a bunch of rumors about the next iphone coming right up and just one of those rumors one of those rumored specs stands out is really interesting because it's the same as last year so first of all just fyi it looks like the mini iphone will be gone and it will be replaced actually by a larger version of the base iphone and if i was a betting person i'd say that's probably going to be the most popular one so the iphone 14 lineup will allegedly be iphone 14 iphone 14 max then iphone 14 pro and iphone 14 pro max and we also know that every year apple has a challenge to try to differentiate between the pro iphones and the non-pro iphones to try to give you reasons to spend the extra money to upgrade we've talked about pricing ladders before in a video i'll link it below like button if you haven't seen it already so with the iphone 13 series the whole lineup was pretty solid and there were a few differentiating factors for the extra money the pro iphone had the extra telephoto camera plus lidar it had the stainless steel around the outside the pro motion display up front the extra ram the higher max storage and a couple other smaller features like pro res etc so naturally some of these features are enough to pull people up to a more expensive pro iphone this year so the iphone 14 has rumored to be a slightly bigger gap between the regular iphone and the pro iphone so take all the same stuff that i just talked about with last year's phones plus the new pro iphone is rumored to be getting this new pill-shaped cutout at the top for face id and the selfie camera so finally getting rid of the notch although it really is just an aesthetic difference it gets you some of those precious pixels back and that's about it and the pro iphone should get a new higher end 48 megapixel main camera while the regular iphone still sits at 12. now the pro will probably also still bend to 12 megapixels but at least you can get more detail out of it and potentially higher resolution video but the most interesting rumor of all of the potential iphone 14 stuff is that only the pro iphone will get the chip upgrade so the iphone 14 pro and pro max will get a shiny new a16 bionic chip and the non-pro iphone 14 and 14 max will actually have the same one-year-old chip that's in the phone i'm already using the a15 bionic and this to me is fascinating for so many reasons where do i even start first of all when have we ever seen two phones launch an entire year apart with the exact same soc the exact same chip in spec i don't think we've ever seen that and i think just out of principle hearing that a lot of nerds and tech people are gonna have a pretty big reaction like i feel like i can basically see the comments already like how can why would apple do this how are they gonna sell us basically the same phone with a new name and try to pretend like it's something new so greedy of them so such an apple thing to do but then again i can also kind of see all the defenses already too first of all there's a chip shortage and shocker no one is immune to it but then also let's be real for a second if i handed you a phone with an a15 bionic and another identical phone with an a14 bionic aside from running a benchmark how long would it take you to actually notice the difference and it would probably take you a really it would take you years down the line to actually start to ever see a difference there and really that's been a huge feature of apple's super high-end chips which is they give you these years of headroom and so maybe it feels kind of like you're shorting these new iphone 14 users of one year of headroom by not upgrading the chip so yeah both sides clearly have a point and it is very interesting and a bit unprecedented to have a brand new flagship iphone ship with the same exact chip as an old flagship iphone it just never happened but it does make a lot of sense we've seen the a15 bionic is obviously a very powerful chip and more than enough for most normal people for a long time and it is also very common for a manufacturer to ship a slightly lower end chip in their lower end phone so high-end chip gets maybe the best snapdragon 8 gen 1 or snapdragon 865 plus or whatever and then their lower tier phone will have a lower tier chip so for me i'm left with one statement and one question the statement just being the fact that i've been saying we are not at peak smartphone yet if apple does this that statement does get a bit weaker of course shipping the same flagship chip although they've said there are some rumors saying there may be like two extra gigs of ram alongside the a15 bionic so it's not the exact same chip as last year but you get the point that it's it's been flattening very much and it feels more than ever like we're at peak smartphone but my one question is how is apple gonna get on stage and talk about the iphone 14 like it's not basically the same phone as the iphone 13 right like unless i'm missing something and there are some really big features that i am not seeing yet that aren't rumored yet you know the apple way is usually just praising their old phone all the time because it's sold really well but then selling it again with a new name at a higher price just doesn't i don't know if that's gonna work like you know how every year on stage they have that slide where after they reveal the price they show the whole lineup of all the different phones they sell at all the different price brackets so this is how that exact slide looked in 2021. i'm trying to figure out what the 2022 version is going to look like so we have the new iphone sc already with 5g that's 429 slots in the bottom there that's fine then i assume we'll have the new iphone 14 let's say that starts at 6.99 and the 14 pro starts still at 9.99 they can keep selling the iphone 12 with the older specs for 4.99 but then do they keep the iphone 13 around for 5.99 can they do that i mean what's the difference here what's that difference for 100 extra dollars you should never get the iphone 14 right what's the explanation on stage going to be are there some new iphone 14 exclusive software features in the pipeline even though they have basically the same specs maybe you'll get one more year of software updates out of it than a 13 maybe those two extra gigs of ram will enable a little bit better headroom and future proofing but that by itself doesn't seem like it's worth a hundred bucks so that is going to be a really interesting detail to pay attention to you know what else is an interesting detail to pay attention to this lower third over here which comes from the mkbhd plug-in that we just made with motion vfx for final cut pro premiere and resolve that's right we have made our own video editing plugin that i've been using and making stuff like that and all kinds of stuff in our video for the past couple weeks the link is below i think it's awesome if you're a creator fellow video maker definitely check it out i'll put a link in the description but yeah just a little quick shout out to our brand new video editing plugin anyway let me know what you think of the way the iphone 14 is shaping up especially versus the iphone 13 and how those could differentiate themselves aside from some new colors maybe thanks for watching catch you guys the next one and in

My 3.5"" Colors phone -> Galaxy A10
Was one of massive upgrade from size to 6.2"" and 2000mb ram (256mb on colors ) and 32gb storage (8mb on colors ) and so much

But I got one plus nord and while specs are very good , their size is not different and I  can do basic stuff on both phones. Gaming is better but if you skip mobile gaming because of micro ( even Genshin Impact after you benchmark and quit the Gacha trap ) then yeah , Gaming phones should emulate otherwise even mobile games are underused. Games max out at about 8gb and that's fine because rest is for multitasking or switching between games. But if you do One game  at a time , 24 Gb is best used for emulation. NGL I'm a sucker  for specs too. 4ghz SOC , 32gb ram , 2Tb storage ufs 4.0 would make me go wow but that's it. Sometimes I feel like I like specs more than device. Have any one of you bought a gaming phone or laptop but not play a lot ? Yet drool over specs .. ?? | It's almost like no reason to buy a phone and wait for long time. Iphone 10 to 14 is okay but in 2024 Iphone 16 come. I say Iphone 16 is best for people in 10 and below.
11 onward is optional
13 onwards is less optional 
15 onwards might as well trade your phone or just be a apple lover. No reason for 16.

I an happy with android but I have dislike them over years. They're being more like apple and copying worst . After One Plus settled , Huawei and Sony is my hope , or Pixel. The BBK in general also a hope. POCO also. But I'd say they're more of budget conscious or extremely well speced phone , but Huawei and One plus had like Huawei was more experimental like LG but not same , One plus was clean and enthusiastic until Color OS merged. Sony is expensive NGL , but I'd buy Sony over iphone all time. They're screen are too good ! And camera too. Ios is fun too. If I was rich I would keep iphones as extra device. I liked android because of diversity. But now even Samsung is boring. These guys got amoled like 12 yes or more ago.. now they're playing it too safe."
7jaMJGtAV9M,David Blaine Teaches Me Magic!,Then I went and tried it on my friends. Waveform Podcast: http://youtube.com/Waveform Studio: http://youtube.com/TheStudio ...,2022-04-25T15:53:00Z,1288763,63227,1866,[Music] [Applause] so i am a little confused because i've never done a magic trick where i have the deck of cards and i have no idea how you can possibly trick me here do you have a deck of cards yeah yeah and do you are you are you skilled with cards at all i'm definitely going to do this to peter mccann and i'm very curious how he's going i'm okay at identifying what's happening i'm not like dexterous with my fingers though i have to have a deck of cards yeah i have to be prepared for this yeah you know just one prop one problem uh i definitely have a deck of cards yeah that's the only a deck of pokemon cards does that work ah can you give me three minutes to look for a deck of cards here i'll try i'll try something else with with this deck it's fun when you have a deck but i'm gonna have you pick a card and see if i can uh okay something see how this is all a totally normal shuffle deck of cards okay so i'm gonna have you take a look through these cards i'm gonna like riffle them to you and just real fast and see if you can pick out a card and don't say it out loud let's see if you can pick one out right okay all right to the camera gotta get the frame rate got it you got it okay so you can pick we could have picked whatever card but you got one so i'm gonna see you can see this right yes i'm just going to take the deck like this and just like totally mix it up face up face down all over the place so it's completely trash like there's no way you could see like your car could be anywhere in here any one of these cars right it could be face up it could be face down look some of them are back to front some of them are front to back oh look some of them are back to back like it could be anything but sure i'm going to put them in this nice little neat pile [Music] make sure you can keep seeing them and would it impress you if if i turned all of these cards to face one direction yes it would definitely impress me it would yes okay cool they're all facing one direction okay that was pretty smooth did you catch that there's there's one card there's one card that's not facing that oh my god that's my card is it is it really oh that's not good that's good all right that's pretty impressive that's pretty impressive thank you thank you i guess last time we spoke we were in the middle of the desert in arizona you had just come down from this balloon trip from was it twenty thousand feet how how did you go i actually went to 25 000. 25 000 which was on my watch but he yelled no no don't pull you after he said go go go and it was really so registered is 24 9 on there okay but i was at 25 on my watch i was on the ground i could see everybody like talking to you in like the whole broadcast set up and that was a fun time you know what threw me for a loop i'm happy it was safe and it was for my daughter and she was there and i wanted to keep it happy and fun and all that stuff i wanted to go higher than anything on earth so mount everest was 29 000 feet a little more than 29 072 feet or something like that yeah i guess because the fa and everybody suddenly thought that i was going to go hypoxic because i wasn't doing the proper o2 breathing so suddenly i'm being remote popped down and i can't keep i'm like where come on what's going on i want to keep going so anyway but but it was a lot of fun when because they were able to remote pop everything yeah they did as soon as i deployed jumped down they recovered the entire rig that was a high-tech experiment like i got to see the like the aftermath of like so you jump out they've got the remote control and like tracking of this huge rig essentially an aircraft it continues to fly they lower it to the ground they recover it like i got to see all that happen yeah i was very impressed with the amount of tech happening even though at its core it's you with some balloons which was amazing but if it was just me and the balloons then it would have actually been something that i wasn't into because i didn't want to just leave balloons to go float away and like destroy the invite you know whatever don't pop in the desert yeah so that's that so the big big team and all the work really was on how do we recover the rig how do we bring everything back down which is they remote pop every single balloon and then lower it yeah so so you put that on youtube yeah and one of my favorite things about like i'm pretty sure i found and i'm sure a lot of people watching this have found your magic on youtube somewhere and if i look back far enough you're easily one of i don't speak to a lot of people who have been uploading to youtube longer than me but you're one of the first people to like blow up on youtube people know david blaine magic from yeah it came yeah it started with youtube so how did you why did you decide to put stuff on youtube because i know my answer but like sharing magic i felt like the medium was was changing so i felt like the natural progression and and now it really is now the only way people look at things is on their phones which is unfortunate but therefore there's also the fortunate part which is they have lots of access to anything that they can think of so you can learn anything from anyone anyone anywhere in the world anytime which is really speeding up the process of the learning curve which is amazing but now there's youtube instagram uh tick tock which i haven't figured out yet i'm so it's so it's so cool on the same page with the exact i think yeah yeah but no no but i'm not against any of it because i i actually like all of it but it's just i have my brain hasn't understood how to do that yet because it's like with youtube it was kind of like magic was perfect because it was like here's a trick here's a reaction boom that's really that that's and that content is quick and it's gratifying but then you know it it started to move too like there's no time for anything it has to be like the fastest trick and the fastest reaction couple seconds yeah yeah yeah quick hits yep i mean i i remember i've seen a lot of your videos and magic and that was that was actually part of the entertaining part was that takes you into a sort of a rabbit hole and you just watch as many as you can you can't get enough and the reactions from people when you do a trick to them and blow their mind is i think you described it this way it's like this universal language like everyone has the same like primal mind-blown reaction to a good trick yeah youtube lets you share that with way more people than if it was just one at a time yeah yeah that's right it allows you to to reach anybody anywhere in the world which is incredible no idea how you can possibly trick me here yeah that's this is what makes it good so you've got the whole deck with you no way i could manipulate it or anything so i'm gonna have you do some stuff and i'm gonna find your card right it's a new it's a new camera thing going okay so you've got your deck right here so don't let me see but from the top of the deck just start dealing cards down onto the table in front of you however many you want and somewhere before halfway you can stop so you can keep it below the camera make sure i can't see it so whenever you want to stop i'll keep talking so i can't hear i can't count but as whenever you want to stop you can stop dealing cards at a time you can do three at a time whatever you want to do a random number before halfway and just stop just let me know when you're good good we're good okay so don't show me your don't show me your hand okay don't show me how many but what you're gonna do is take the top card and flip it over and check and see what it is okay and then flip it back over so that's your card don't let me see it but just remember what that card is okay there's no way i can know what this card is at this point but what we're gonna do is like if for example it was a three you'll take three cards from the big pile and put them face down on top of your card so if it was a five you put five on top if it was a jack it's eleven i quite like it if you turn around oh my god yeah he's turning around i can't possibly see how many you're dealing you're putting them on top right so this is just so you you definitely remember your card you know the number and everything then take that small pile pick it up put it on top of the big pile it goes back into one deck got it amazing below the camera that was perfect so you agree there's no way i could know what card you've got where it is in the deck it could be anywhere right you could have picked whatever you wanted i'm gonna have you start dealing from the top one card at a time and you're going to read the cards to me one at a time so i'm going to turn them over and tell you what they are you're going to turn them over and tell me what they are one at a time right four although wait sorry pause one i want to have you cut the deck from the middle okay okay put that you put that back on top right so take that from the middle cut the entire deck in half so you've completed the cut yep there you go yes and then cut it and put it back on top so now you've swapped the top and the bottom perfect okay so now we're gonna deal from the top one at a time face down until we've got your card we'll go all the way through two of hearts three of hearts ace of clubs six of hearts seven of hearts eight of hearts this was a fresh pack nine hearts queen of clubs king of clubs king of diamonds you're holding a card in your hand queen of diamonds oh yeah keep going keep going jack of diamonds and then we've just got ace of hearts wow that you did not shuffle that very much i did not shuffle that very much you saw me unbox the pack do you agree that there is no chance i could there's no technology i could possibly use to like you know turn off center stage and like check your hand or like see anything there's no like incredible audio feature that could let me hear how many you counted or anything like that there's just there's no way you don't know where i cut the deck and i put the bottom half on top so no i don't think you have any idea yeah okay okay um well you're right i do i do have a card here um i'm curious if your card is also this card how did you do that ah did i did i get it i got it right two of clubs okay that's a pretty good start it's like you reached through the phone and like messed up my deck for me what so now there's a sort of a new chapter because i've seen all these i've seen all these tricks and all these incredible things you've done but you've now decided to make a class and actually teach magic so i've been reluctant forever to do magic kits or do any of those types of things which is ironic because my mother's a teacher and my brother's a teacher so they're both teachers so i always do understand the amazing and important effect that you have by teaching people stuff that you're that you worked really hard on but i was still reluctant because magic is such a a confusing area because these secrets are so powerful but you don't want to just give them away because that's part of the art itself so every time somebody said to me though could you teach me a trick i always feel bad that i can't you know it's like i want to of course i want to and often i do teach them something quickly like i'll be like here i could teach you something but that's not really good enough so the idea of being able to create any kind of class that i wanted with studio which is max called me up and he was he understood all about magic he did all of his research he could perform magic he also learned how to play chess so he could play magnus and he lasted quite a few moves against him and he learned how to memorize a deck so when he showed me all these things he said i'll do whatever you want to make this class something that's incredible and amazing yeah it was it was it was very difficult to say no to that because and i know if anybody wants to take the class they're not just going to get the secrets they're going to be they have to actually enroll they have to like commit to it it's a month-long class so the idea of a student trying to learn some of the things that were what got me started some of the basic things in magic that i love i think that was kind of the inspiration and that's what led me to agree to do this yeah so being able to put out something actually good and like that you have control over and that you can really make amazing and share this with as many people as possible is that's like 2022 david blaine that's pretty sick it's dope i i also want to ask you like how do you decide what stuff to to share in the class versus what stuff you continue to work on and evolve so most of the stuff that i share is actually for beginners for people that are you know beginner intermediate people that want to be able to like walk into a situation and do some magic and not you know it's i think it's such an amazing art form and it's so it's so such a deep dive into psychology it's technical it's math it's science it's logic it's all these things combined and there's a philosophy behind it so i feel like the people that you know come come into it i feel like they'll have a a a new appreciation for the actual art of magic itself actually i think like you're gonna suddenly realize oh wow when this magician's doing a trick he does it's a lot of work it's not just like he's doing this quick trick that has no meaning and it's like oh he learned it for three seconds and now he can do it's like oh wow these guys all these magicians out there work really hard at their craft and it's special can confirm i mean you're seeing it now but you've taught me a little bit i've been working on the tricks i can't even do this yeah but you learned it fast wait let me see if i can do one right now what is it called again charlie cut yeah you learned it fast is there a person yeah there you go yep perfect it's not yeah it's deep no you just did it but you learned it fast but that's the that's the type of the next phase would be like this oh see that's just the next would be like this these are the ones that but these are the ones that i don't go into teaching because these are you know this is this is different i do like the those things the evolution of a trick like here's level one here's level two here's level three that's that's sick take this whole deck and and divide it into three like roughly equal sized piles in front of you and don't shuffle before uh you it's shuffled already i think right you got a couple shuffles in so give me three equal sized piles in front of you don't let me see them and you can you know adjust it make sure they're about three equal sized piles okay they're pretty good you want to see them no you're good just leave him i don't want to see i don't i don't want to cheat and like see the see the the cards oh yeah you know this technology is crazy i might be able to see through the cars so take any one of those piles and flip it face up whichever one you want okay the whole thing's face up yep and you've got a card now on the top of that pile yeah that's your card so remember that card commit that to memory there's no way i could know it that's your selection yeah and then what i want you to do is take that face up pile the whole thing and put it on top of one of the face down piles okay right uh uh still up though still face up yep and then take the other face down pile and put it on top of the face up pile so you just made a sandwich yep so you got all your cards in here now some of them are face up some are face down and uh do your best to like roughly in the middle cut the deck and don't complete the cut so you just have two piles now am i showing this to you nope nope don't let me see it okay cut it in half you've got a face up half and a face down half and just put them into each other this is the part where you give me uh your uh little riffle shuffle one of these so we're really mixing up nah nah off camera the whole thing just mixing the crap out of this deck right now you are making me ruin these cards you still remember your card right you still got it on my card okay perfect well like there are like half of them are up and half of them are down yeah it's it's crazy it's pretty messed up right now just for fun just give me a give me another cut just just cut it in half and complete the cut like that so like there's really truly no way you can cut it again if you want like just making sure there's absolutely no chance in these 52 cards that i could know what it is where it is it's face up face time whatever right yeah so i want you to take this deck you've you've shuffled and one at a time from the top deal the cards into a pile and each one that is face up read the card out loud but don't like let me see it don't change your voice if you hit if you hit your card or not just say all them the exact same so i could never know just read through the deck one at a time deal them face up let me know which ones are face up deal them all one on top of another all right king of spades ace of diamonds queen of spades three of clubs that's it that's it okay you know the crazy stat about like like a card deck can be in any order like there's like some crazy number of like orders it can be in like 52 factorial it's like more more stars in the universe or something like that yeah um it would be pretty miraculous if from that shuffle from all that we just did i could find your card i might be shocked i'd be pretty shocked there's no text i would be shocked i would be shocked i would be shocked actually you know what's funny actually i uh i have another i have a pocket on the other side you remember no way dude okay you've seen these okay and uh so again i'd be shocked if this worked but let me know uh if this is also your card holy no way no way did i i got it sounds like i got it you've done like these tricks to almost any person i can name has experienced some sort of incredible magic who's your uh who's your favorite reaction you've gotten i mean you know there's so many amazing reactions but you mean on somebody like well known or whatever maybe you did a trick and you just were like i can't believe this person loved the trick so much i mean i i was once at a dinner with uh a dear friend of mine and mickey rourke and tupac and you know tupac we were at cafe to back and he was smoking at the table so he's a little buzzed and i start doing magic to him and the next thing i know i look over and he's like on the floor laughing like kicking his legs like a little kid and that was yeah that was a pretty and he's also tupac you know so that was a pretty exciting reaction but there's all kinds of reactions that i get that are amazing and sometimes it's the opposite it might just be somebody's completely still like a kid that i did magic to in a barstow and i made a coin disappear over saying it was in my first show i've seen that yeah yeah and he just stood there and he's like cool and that was all and i obsessed over him but you know and then i wanted to put that trick on abc and they were like no it's not his reaction i was like this is the best thing and then after that i think he got a taco bell commercial or something that's an iconic and that's all over youtube that's exactly that's what i'm talking about see and then what was funny was those spoof videos that came like not that long ago like 10 years ago or something had those like david blaine street magic videos did you enjoy those yeah that was some of my favorite videos now that guy mikey day has uh he got a uh a lead in snl after that that's incredible that's incredible you know magic these types of things they're all creative i view you as a creator basically this is what i'm saying like you you put stuff online you adjust the way you present you you're creative in the way you combine things and you're able to to make something new and that it's like amazing and you get to share with people and that's like inspiring for me so i appreciate that thank you but hold on i want to say one other thing marquez so so like i said i always try to teach people magic yeah right like i'm always like the way you are with your hands and your ability to learn it's it's it's mind-blowing it was a very fast learning curve as you know it just that was i was very impressed you know and and once again that was part of my excitement in the beginning was just i know you're so athletic you're so smart you're so telling so seeing the immediate learning curve was inspiring and then you pulled the stuff off quickly yeah yeah no i i had the best teachers so i definitely had a pretty pretty good head start there yeah but you you you the way you learned it and the way you pulled it off right away we did it to your crew did it over zoom yeah and you improvised you came up with stuff so that you know that that was for me that wasn't that's worth the whole thing right there like watching you learn and adjust and and come up with things and it was fun if your card is the eight of clubs it isn't it's fine i was just kidding is it this one [Laughter] [Music] did i get it i think i got it what the hell that looks like i got it you're reaching through my screen it's not even fair he learned he learned he learned very fast what it took a second it took a second i was by the way i didn't help him i mean i taught him but i didn't help him there's a difference i don't have like someone who works at crete airport all right all right i guess you learned from the master but that's legitimately really impossible appreciate it thank you but how could he have known what you were thinking regardless oh what's up man how you doing by the way just so you know just you know i was watching so even though he put the cards at a frame nothing funny was done he did all of what you saw exactly wow yeah i didn't help at all he did it all himself that whole thing that is super impressive well call us back one day when you have your own deck of non non-pokemon he pulled off the impossible wow david i've watched a lot of your stuff online over the years you're you're magnificent i think you just got a a dose of the the new version of being able to do this through the screen like that is unbelievable but there's something really eerie about controlling your own deck and controlling your own cuts and your own shuffles away from you and just happening like that is bizarre face up oh hold on this is weird hold on tilt the camera down move the pile in your hand away move it away move it away you drop him get rid of him look what he's been holding since before this began turn it shown and by the way you didn't even you turned them upside down right side up you did what you wanted [Music] i wish i had more time to take this in this has blown my mind all right shout out to david blaine himself for teaching me magic literal dream come true also we had a full-on longer extended conversation with some really interesting questions so i'm gonna put that entire chat on the next episode of the waveform podcast you can subscribe to the waveform channel right here and uh we also did some magic in the studio i did some tricks to the people here but david

MKBHD Merch: http://shop.MKBHD.com Ford's official page: ...,2022-04-18T21:55:51Z,1664232,96568,4228,"[Music] what's up M kbd here and I today now have a new favorite two-door electric vehicle and when I say that out loud it you probably picture one thing this is very [Music] different so I've been talking about these electric vehicle prototypes for a bit you know I've been saying they're easy to build you can make one cuz it's true we see car companies all the time just build one single car with a custom chassis on some electric motors a battery and boom they prayed that around but the hard part is building and shipping them in Mass but all that being said this is easily one of the coolest electric car builds I've ever seen so it's made by Ford and this is actually a concept car so they don't even have plans to ship it but after seeing all the reactions to this and driving it around for myself for a day I I think it would be amazing if they reconsidered it but either way let me show you around this thing so basically what you're looking at right now is a 1978 Ford F100 Illuminator but under the hood is the guts of a 2022 Ford Mustang Mach e GT that's the performance Edition it is a wild ju toos of brand new 2022 things alongside the 40-year-old solid metal and glass things of this older truck I swear if this was a Doug deiro video there' be endless quirks and features but yeah the final result here is an electric truck that not only looks like really nothing else on the road but it actually drives basically the same as the performance Edition Machi which is one of the faster ones out there 480 horsepower over 600 lb feet of torque yes you can break hold launch yes it does 0 to 60 in 3.5 seconds and yeah it does feel and look and sound ridiculous while doing it now I don't know about you but I don't get a chance to look at trucks from 1978 very often so sorry if this is like super unsurprising but pretty much everything about the outside of this truck is either in awesome shape or custom rebuilt as new so it's got the style and the the lines of the times it's got the silver and copper paint colors the old school wheels are also customed to match and they also happen to hide the bright red performance calipers of the maki's brakes under there pretty well and just poking around this thing it's fun to see how much of the original body is left untouched this 6-ft bed is is basically completely solid metal uh and the tailgate super heavy to open and close cuz there's no mechanical assistance like modern trucks even the doors when you open them I don't know I just find it fascinating that you can just look at the mechanical method right in there for holding the door open at two different amounts probably the only way you would know that this is a Resto mod if you saw it on the street would be if maybe you noticed the camera cutouts there's one in the back license plate here for the reverse camera and there's another one up at at the front in the grill cutout up here at which point you realize the whole Grill is fake it's just a black plastic in there like the rest of the Mustang makis well either that or you happen to see it plugged in and charging because that's a giveaway that flap at the front left bumper is in fact a normal CCS charging port the inside though okay this is where it goes crazy there is a healthy combination of old and new and even some new that's disguised as old to fit better with the general aesthetic I think it's super cool now obviously there's no hiding the dashboard it's got the Mach e huge vertical touchcreen with the knob and everything and there's also a display as the dash behind the steering wheel so not the original Dash I think some people would have wanted the original Dash but there's so many new systems and things going on here like the fact that it's showing me 200 miles of range for example that I just don't know how they could convert all that stuff so all the software is in here it's working the backup and forward cameras are functional they also brought in the headlight controls from the mai but I did notice they're sideways so maybe they didn't fit in the normal spot and then the more you look around the more you see Parts cleverly disguised as old the steering wheel for example it's new but it says F100 on it and it's got the brown color and the seats are all new but with the tan color to match the rest of the interior which is completely decidedly old school so you get the Plaid stitching at the bottom of the door little metal pieces everywhere like for adjusting the side view mirrors the glove compartment is just a metal box like nothing fancy at all and the entire ceiling too is stitched with leather and the sun visors are just like metal wires with leather pieces on them uh there's also old school speakers behind the seats that are hooked up and seem to be playing great quality audio which leads me to believe they're also new disguised as old and you better believe this car has manual rolling up Windows there's no way they could get rid of that it's basically mandatory for a car of this style so yeah a little bit of old and a little bit of new and this is the combo you get it's just so funny seeing this old whip rolling around through the windshield but you can still see the top half of a huge touchcreen that's only in new cars it seems sacrilegious to have a center console with wireless chargers right next to manual rollup windows and door locks but that's really what this is all about it's adding the modern Creature Comforts to a comfortable familiar old truck so I did get to drive this thing around the studio a bit for a day before Ford went and took it away to the I think they brought it straight to the New York Auto Show but I really got three main questions from people that I showed this to one what's under the hood interesting question two how does it drive and three can I get one all good questions so first of all literally under the hood is Mustang Maki so this is a custom chassis holding things together by a company called Roadster shop but yeah basically all the electronics and HVAC and wiring things that are normally in the front of a mai and hidden they're all still here plus basically that open bucket for storage where the front trunk is so yeah this thing still has a real front trunk this 1978 restomod Ford F100 has a bigger front trunk than most other electric cars on the road right now so okay how does it drive this is a funny one so it's quite a character as you can imagine very livable and smooth and normal at low speeds like around a neighborhood this would actually be totally fun to drive and maybe forgive me if this is sacriligious but I think i' would prefer to drive this over the 70s version because you got the electric torque it's smooth and Silent no gear shifting you've got regenerative braking one pedal driving is great but it's also a massively wide metal truck that can Lurch from 0 to 60 in 3.5 seconds and if you really pin it and start playing with it like it has very impressive acceleration but it's obviously not going to handle great like you can feel the dipping and swaying of the chassis more than pretty much anything else capable of going this fast I didn't have it long enough to see how well the range holds up but hey if it's quoting me about 200 mil of range that's not amazing but that's also not terrible considering this thing has the aerodynamics of a block of cheese so after playing with it like I said people were like where can I actually get one of these and like I said it is a concept car so this isn't an actual version that you'll ever be able to buy but Ford is selling a crate motor that you can actually use to convert other older cars to Electric so you don't have to build everything by hand like Zach is with his Hummer EV so and it's only $4,000 it's 3,900 bucks for that which was lower than I expected it to be so I think that's the big takeaway of this this concept truck which is so cool is really just a proof of concept and I I think it's awesome I want to shout out Ford for making something so fun like this definitely tag or send someone this video who would want a retro modern truck like this that's really what this is the ultimate retr modern truck thanks for watching subscribe for more and I'll see you guys in the next one peace [Music]","Please don't put rims on it. | If this was mass produced 80% would be swapped back to gas ,       Within the first week.        That’s just the way it would go 😂pretty neat tho | Every single time I hear “Mustang”Mach E it hurts 

Thanks for not including the word Mustang every single time | Doug is a type of guy-

WAIT this is not a doug video | they didn't even bother to replace the mach-e animation in the dashboard ui😂 | nice shout out to my boi doug | 8.87835226 × 10^5662 is pretty far in the future | This is so cool and this is how all Evey’s should be bring back old designs, reuse and recycle old chassis and incorporate the electric aspect of it into it | Love the outer body from 1978 with the machine inside from 2022. What a beautiful ❤
I would love to buy if ford brings it to the market. | I love the look of that"
MiTG1ride7s,I Gave the Pixel Another Chance...,6 months later with the buggy Pixel 6 Pro That shirt: http://shop.MKBHD.com Pixel 6 Review: https://youtu.be/9hvjBi4PKWA ...,2022-04-14T02:04:12Z,3086672,114778,6561,all right so i usually keep you all updated on this but a lot of people ask and maybe you don't know so i have access to a lot of different phones and the question is usually is what phone do you use on the daily so the phone that i keep coming back to after i review a phone for the past year and a half on android has been samsung's galaxy s21 ultra so it's a pretty long time for me a lot of phones have come out since then including the s22 ultra but i keep coming back to this one you know it's the design the display the cameras are rock solid the software is really good full of features it's been great now a lot of people assumed that it would change to the pixel series when that came out in october and i really like the phones but as i said in my review it's not perfect and then slowly ever since it came out it's gotten more and more buggy now that's always one of the challenges of reviewing something right people usually own their phone for years but i have to try to experience as much of this as possible in one to two weeks and then condense it all down into a 10 or 20 minute video or in the pixels case 21 minutes and 49 seconds damn but yeah a couple weeks and a couple months after the review period it slowly started unraveling more and more bugs started showing up and i'm not really sure why i can't really tell you exactly why it's happening but i do know now that the pixels seem to be more susceptible to it matter of fact this exact thing this situation we're going through now has happened before when i was using the pixel 2 xl i had the same thing happen the bugs got worse and worse up until the point where i stopped using it and switched to i think it was some oneplus phone that was performing well at the time and i made a video about it so i'm not sure what makes the pixel so much more susceptible to it than other phones but i was hoping that this time you know having their own tensor design chip and getting those quick software updates straight from google would maybe help alleviate that this time but i was wrong so this phone came out in october by january i was tweeting that my pixel 6 pro has slowly gotten so buggy since launch that i can no longer recommend it at 900 which is still how much it cost by the way straight from google so that combined with the botched january software update had me giving up a little bit and i put my sim card back into the s21 ultra which by the way got that january security update before the pixel did but here we are in april so it's been a couple months and a couple successful software updates later and hey if i'm gonna publicly talk about the downfall of the pixel then they put out some software updates to fix it i wanna know about it i wanna test it so i've done that six months after launch now i've got my sim card back in the pixel and i've been using it and while it's better than it was it's still not enough to change my opinion on it so my overall thoughts on this phone are pretty much the same as the review when it came out like i said i do actually really like this design which has proved to be polarizing some people love it some people hate it i'm into it and you can see all the use now i did get it pretty scratched up i got a big gash a pretty deep one on the top left corner of my display but that's par for the course for me i don't use phone cases all the time so yes it still collects dust all the way around those cameras yes it's showing normal wear and tear from the months of being in and out of pockets on tables and tossed around all this is normal and the industrial design itself is still held up it's very solid but the question is what were the things that were specifically going wrong with the user experience on this phone that made it such a pain to use luckily i wrote them down so the big ones for me were number one it's 120 hertz display but it was constantly constantly slowing down to way below that way below 90 often below 60 which was annoying this big stuttery animations all the time opening and closing apps so that was my number one problem the camera oh lock screen and auto brightness were also both terrible no matter how dim of a room i was in it would never lower the brightness enough even though auto brightness was on the fingerprint reader is slow compared to the others and the camera is slowing down so since then i'm now on the march security update and the constant frame drops are 95 fixed and the camera app is back to normal launch speed love that that was a huge one for me but the auto brightness is still bad and the fingerprint reader is still slow compared to the others also often when i'm in a dark room and i turn the flashlight on for some reason it always decides to raise the brightness of the display way up why i don't know i'm still in a dark room and i turn the flashlight on so clearly it's a dark room but maybe there's some sort of light leakage into the ambient light sensor or something here i think that could be fixed with software but we'll see some other things that didn't make it into my tweet though the modem and just overall cell connectivity is noticeably worse than other phones which affects battery life so i have a i have a dead zone that i drive through on the way to work every day and i can kind of notice with each different phone i'm testing how long it takes to regain signal for the maps app to work again and this takes longer than any other phone and i've also had issues with wi-fi calling just that feature specifically and in this studio with double thick glass and all this acoustic treatment the signal in here isn't great already to start with and so i rely on wi-fi calling and that feature has not let me make a call in like two days in a row here which is pretty bad and there's still a bunch of subtle stuff that's not necessarily a bug but just affects the overall feel of the phone like swiping between the home screen and google page should always be pretty smooth that's a basic animation but it's not on the pixel awkwardly enough other android phones like the s21 ultra have no problem with this and i also with this phone have had a weird bluetooth streaming random bug to my car like i'll be listening to music and it'll skip like a second of audio like a cd haven't had a phone do that in a long time but like i said the newest updates have reduced a lot of the like performance problems and the stuttering and the animations that really made it feel bad so it's better than it was but if the acceptable level of bugginess for a 900 phone was like here it used to be up here and now it's here it's still worse than it should be but they have made an improvement but that being said this is still a very strange trajectory for the user experience of a smartphone like typically you get a phone and for the first year at least it's peaches nothing's wrong and then as it ages it slowly goes downhill over time but it feels like the pixels age concerningly quickly and google has to try to stay on top of that with like a frantic software update or two very early very odd so at this point i've given the pixel 6 pro another chance and i still don't think people should be buying the pixel 6 pro for 900 bucks but you know it's been six months so now i'm starting to look forward right so we have a couple pixel 6a rumors popping up here and there that'll probably come out this summer that's probably going to be another phone with this first gen tensor chip probably a plastic body 1080p display maybe 90 hertz that would be nice probably one to two cameras and that'll be their budget phone for the middle of the year but i'm very interested in the next generation of tensor chip and the next pixel maybe it's just because i'm optimistic maybe it's just because i am i trust that google will finally buckle down the google phone experience and deliver something good but yeah that's this is something we're going to have to keep an eye on now is the way pixels age over time seems to consistently be very different from the way we expect other normal phones to age but hey that's just one more factor to consider when reviewing these things for now like i've said my sim card is gonna be again back in the s21 ultra until the next review anyway but let me know what your thoughts are in the comments section below let's talk about it either way thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace [Music],"Future me 2024 Dec 
Pixel 6 update the software and android it's one of the best phone in my opinion | I had the Pixel 2XL, 4XL, and 7. I wanted them to work and be amazing but truly they sucked. I bought the zfold 6. Best decision I've made by far | ill give it another chance for the Android 15 😅 | Is this taken care of with Android 15? | I really got to say l like MKBHD alot accept for the fact that he always looks for something wrong with a phone not something good with it l really think you should change your mindset towards phones | Slow and buggy camera was the reason I once switched from several android phones (including oneplus and nexus) to iphones. | have all the problems been fixed now after the updates? | Hey mkbhd. So a lot of people actually are thinking of buying these phones a year or 2 after they are released. That means that reviews like this are very helpful. If you could manage to hire someone who could be doing these kind of reviews under your brand name. | i got a pixel 6 pro a few weeks ago and i instantly fell in love | and against all advice, I bought this and have suffered. Just stopped booting. Repair technicians could not determine the cause"
dQrBgda0sEY,The SteamDeck is Incomplete But Fun!,"SteamDeck is so fun, I'm hoping it doesn't get killed off like the rest of Valve's... attempts The water bottles! http://MKBHD.com ...",2022-04-11T22:27:22Z,2684204,98895,5193,oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey what's up mkbhd here all right right off the top shout out to the new water bottles that are finally in the mkbhd.com store solid metal double insulated 18 ounces and we did make a light mode and a dark mode and normally i am a dark mode type of person but i think this might be the first time i'm actually a little more drawn to and have been using light mode just saying i'll leave that up to you guys to choose i'll keep an eye on which one sells more but choose wisely either way they hydrated but either way this this right here is the valve steam deck teased it a little while ago it turns out there's a lot of hype around this and now that i've been using it for a bit i can clearly see that there's not a lot of people that i would actually recommend this to but for those people they're going to have a lot of fun with it so the steam deck is a 399 dollar handheld gaming console with a screen surrounded by non-removable controls with basically a mini pc inside if you haven't heard about it it can kind of be difficult to understand what a steam deck is i guess the natural reaction is oh it's a like a nintendo switch on steroids but it really is a lot more than that now valve isn't exactly known for making a ton of great hardware like we know steam of course and they make some games but they have made some less successful hardware projects like they made the steam controller which was eventually discontinued and the steam link which was also discontinued and let's not even get started on steam machines and it's not even clear at this point how long the steam deck will last but i'm rooting for it so the challenge for the steam deck is this is meant to be able to play any of the games in your steam library wherever you want which is an amazing goal but the problem is a lot of these games all are designed with different controller mechanics in mind some of them are for mouse and keyboard some of them are for a controller some of them are just a keyboard some of them are hybrids whatever you want and so the steam deck is trying to let you play as many of those games as possible by adapting to them now i don't know what kind of gamer you are but for me personally i get like really heavy into one maybe two games at a time and then i play them a ton until i'm sick of them and then i move on you know some other people have a bunch of games and rotation for either person though basically i don't think you're going to be able to be quite as good at the game as you were on pc but that's often outweighed by how fun it is to be able to play this game in all these new places that you could never play before so let me just say ergonomically i think the steam deck is pretty great it's much much bigger than a switch but it's still impressively light it's 688 grams basically it's like one and a half times the switch it's made of all plastic here but there is not much flexion at all no creaking the thing feels very well built and then there's just tons of controls so first of all it's a glass touch screen up front seven inch diagonal 1280 by 800 60 hertz ips display then there's abxy buttons there's a d-pad there's two thumb sticks with this nice texture there's also two touch pads with haptic feedback there's a menu button top right and a view button top left the steam button that brings up the steam menu on the bottom left and the quick settings button on the bottom right that gives you things like battery life and frame rate limits and brightness etc then there's four shoulder buttons on the top r1 r2 and l1 l2 and there's four more assignable grip buttons around the back so r4 r5 and l4 l5 and they're all pretty well laid out i mean those back buttons sit comfortably where your fingers usually sit the grip is nicely curved it feels natural to hold the speakers of course are up front facing you and then up top is the volume buttons a headphone jack for some headphones and a usb c port for charging but then at the bottom is a micro sd card slot which is surprisingly important see the 399 is the baseline version and that will get you 64 gigs the lowest amount of storage and that also is the slowest storage if you haven't just check your steam library real quick there's a pretty good chance you'll find at least one game that's more than 64 gigs so this 256 gig version i have here is 529 and then there is a half terabyte 649 version coming later which apparently also has a nano etched display but yeah i only have two games that i'm playing on my steam library right now one is called dirt rally it's about 40 gigs and the other is nba 2k 22 and it's 117 gigs and so i don't really have much room for any other games but the nice thing is like i said there's that micro sd card slot which just pops in and out like normal like that and you can just add a terabyte of extra storage and impressively and thankfully that actually will give you totally normal performance playing games off of that card so i would recommend saving a little bit and getting one of these too but yeah once i got the steam deck really all i wanted to do was just play some games so i got my two good games going and immediately was playing them in places i had never played those games before typically i have to sit in the one room where the gaming pc and monitor and keyboard and everything is set up but i was playing dirt rally sitting on a couch or just in random other rooms this could easily extend out anywhere the back of a car or on a flight the waiting room at a doctor's office i don't know basically anywhere where you can catch a spare hour or two you can play a game now there is a tiny bit of latency that you can sort of mentally calibrate for again this goes back to me saying you're not going to be as good in the game as you would be on a pc but i was able to get used to it enough to make it enjoyable and i think that's where focusing on the numbers on paper will get you kind of lost you know it runs a custom amd apu it has 16 gigs of ram you might be tempted as a gamer to say oh well what if what if it had 90 hertz or 120 hertz display or focusing on faster storage to reduce latency a little would have been nice but the battery life the battery life it's rated for two to eight hours and i'll just say you'll definitely get closer to two a lot more often than you'll get close to eight so 60 hertz is fine 1280 by 800 on a 7 inch display is fine and the controllers and ergonomics are really good they're comfy the other game that i mentioned i play a lot nba 2k works great again you got to take a few games to calibrate for the slight delay between moving the controls and then the actual player moving even if you're not playing online like it's most noticeable when shooting free throws or really any type of shooting where that's timing related but once you get the hang of that it's fun i mean i've never i've literally never played nba 2k anywhere other than on my couch with the playstation in front of me or on a gaming computer in the studio so i'm out here sitting on a random couch with no tv in the room playing 2k on a flight playing 2k anywhere away from the normal setup is so new it just felt like unlocking a level of fun that i couldn't access before but here's the x factor these games that i've been playing work really well on the steam deck because those controls are already mapped great because those are games that are typically played with controllers i mean you could get a wheel for dirt but those are games that are already mapped great so you'll notice if you try to go into the menus in 2k or something with a different part of the deck like the touchscreen or the touch pads yeah those things don't really work very well they've tried to map it but it's pretty bad it's inconsistent it's imprecise you'd never use them but at least the controls that are supposed to work do that's why it's in the great on deck section in the steam store they had to make a specific section for games whose controls map over perfectly but there's a lot of games whose controls don't map over well or have unknown compatibility where it's really a toss-up and there are games in the steam store that are just straight up unsupported on steam deck and they won't work so anytime you search the store you can leave verified games only which works really well or you can risk it a little and include games that are playable but not perfect and that'll just be up to you as of right now apex legends pubg destiny 2 fall guys and a bunch of others are completely incompatible with the steam deck so in that sense it's pretty rough but this isn't really meant to be looked at like a switch on steroids this really is much more of a full-on computer shrunken down to be more portable so the hard carry case that it comes with i really like it i think it's very good the fans and the exhaust vent at the top are pretty much constantly working it takes like five minutes of gaming before it's spitting out hot air and the 45 watt charger that it comes with you pretty much have to take it everywhere if you want a game for more than about three hours but the reward for dealing with all of these trade-offs is being able to play these games in all sorts of places that you've probably never been able to play these games before and that's the fun of it so even though they're ergonomically similar and it's like tempting to compare this to a nintendo switch they're not even in the same category at all and they're for completely different audiences too the steam deck already has a pretty hardcore community that's mapping the controls to various new games this thing has gotten a ton of software updates from valve since i first got it bug fixes extra features experimental stuff there's people out here plugging it into a monitor and a keyboard and a mouse and it'll happily run linux like a straight up portable pc and apparently if you take it apart there's enough room inside for a whole air tag so instead of waiting for a lost and found feature to be added you can just do that but probably my favorite as you can see is my white steam deck there's of course no actual white steam deck but i've got a skin on it from our channel sponsor dbrand and they also sent over their steam deck glass which is available now it is a precisely perfect fit screen protector that keeps the screen sensitivity on point and they've got a whole line of steam deck accessories under the project name kill switch which is hilarious so the steam deck is fun even if i'm not the biggest gamer in the world just being able to take these couple new games to new places and play them in places i would never ordinarily be able to that's the fun of it if you want that experience then you should try to get a steam deck but there's not a lot of people in that group but if you are yeah check it out even if half the games don't work yet thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace [Music],"W | Games aren't incompatible...it's unknown if they work well.

1Cw-vODp-8Y,YouTube Needs to Fix This,YouTube comments spam has been next-level out of control for months. That shirt: http://shop.MKBHD.com ThioJoe's Tool: ...,2022-04-02T00:26:01Z,3064903,192632,14566,[Music] okay so i was at this meeting a long time ago with google and youtube i don't even know if i'm allowed to talk about this yet but it was so long ago proud it doesn't matter uh but eric schmidt was there and he said something that i remember super clearly to this day i'll never forget the quote which was every problem that we have is a problem at scale and the more i think about that the crazier it is i mean it makes a lot of sense youtube is a huge site so youtube right now in 2022 has 2.6 billion monthly active users that means that if there's a problem that's so small it only affects 0.1 percent of people on youtube that problem now affects 2.6 million people so if you're running a company that big that affects this many people like there's gonna be a lot of decisions that come across their plate that are going to affect large groups of people and obviously there's got to be a threshold that you set where you can't do tons of things every single day but once it reaches the threshold then you got to make a choice so maybe oh you know something comes up that's affecting a third of youtube users that makes 4k videos loads slowly or something all right we'll do something about that or hey looks like three percent of youtube users are getting dislike bombed so we'll do something about it we'll just get rid of dislikes from the whole site but there are still going to be small little issues all the time that are below that threshold that affect a tiny tiny fraction of the site 0.1 0.01 percent and that isn't a big enough issue to spend money on fixing but it's still affects millions of people but this issue i really just from my experience on youtube i have to think that it has gotten above that threshold and that is comment spam so really any recently uploaded video you go to on youtube by a relatively active creator you will undoubtedly come across comments with duplicate names and profile pictures like this thanks for watching message right away i have something for you thanks for the feedback expect more videos very soon send direct message i have something for you congratulations you've been selected amongst our shortlisted winners and they're usually the first or only reply on a lot of the most recent and most popular comments on any video doesn't really matter what the comment is about they'll figure if you're leaving a comment you're engaged enough to see it and fall for it and their goal is to get you off of youtube onto a telegram message or whatsapp message now if you're thinking well damn that's stupid that's obviously not going to work it's clearly fake well that's what i would think too but i started getting emails and tweets first it was like one email a day or someone once would tweet at me and then it was two a day or three a day and then it was several every day now at this point every day i wake up to at least a dozen new emails of people sending me screenshots of conversations they think they've had with me just checking to make sure they sent the money to the right place or whether or not the paypal payment went through these people are claiming to have a giveaway prize ready to ship and they just need you to pay one or 200 bucks for shipping and if that's just the people who have thought to email me imagine how many other people are falling for this and not emailing me that i'm not seeing like that is a serious bummer and the crazy part to me is you would think the comment section would be this precious priority for youtube because it's such a unique feature of the site this is one of the only places that you can facilitate real conversations between the creators and the audience between you and i it's what makes youtube youtube like i remember back when i started on youtube i had email notifications turned on for everything so every new comment and every new subscriber i got an email for it and i would reply to every single comment on every single video for years actually but this was my portal into the community now these days obviously i can't reply to everything but i do still try to spend a lot of time in the comments section and talking to people but i end up spending most of my time blocking channels of people trying to scam my audience out of money and keep in mind this is just the spam flavor of the moment like these spammers like any other bad actors are always going to try to adapt and evolve and be as effective as possible all the time so like on my channel if i'm doing a giveaway or even if i'm not they'll know they can slip in and talk about like maybe doing a tech giveaway but on jacksepticeye's channel he just did a video about a month ago talking about how commenters will try to get you to go to their adult sites with just copying and pasting another highly rated comment and then just getting a bunch of bots to upvote it to the top linus made a video this year on comment spam his channel gets plenty of crypto stuff along with pc related giveaways and you can imagine on any mr beast video or any channels in that cinematic universe there's just going to be money giveaway spam there's just so much spam and with the number of places the number of channels that i've seen this comment spam running rampant on i feel like it has to be associated with some level of negative sentiment of just a bad feeling of spending time in the youtube comments section so now there are moderation tools that youtube has built to help keep comments and check right they've gotten better over time there's an automatic spam filter that does a pretty decent job and catches a lot of stuff and just recently this button to hide user from channel will actually work retroactively so it'll block the channel but then also remove all the comments they've ever made on any of my videos but i've spent a lot of time doing this and the more time you spent trying to keep up with the spam the more you realize that not enough is being done so now youtuber theo joe you might have heard of him he's made an open source tool that will scan for spam comments and is much better than youtube at identifying all of them and just on my last video alone out of around 6 000 comments scanned it found that nearly 2 000 of them were identified as spam 2 000 spam comments look i don't know how bad something has to get to get on youtube's radar to cross that threshold but if 30 of the comments on my new video are spam that's just not a good look so okay what should be done that's the real question right uh and i think there are two things one is a community built solution and two is a youtube built solution but only one of those things actually exists effectively right now so the community built solutions can actually put a dent in things by users that are active and and going through and doing this type of stuff all the time so that tool by theo joe that i mentioned earlier it's multi-platform it works on windows and on mac and if you plug in your youtube info you can purge youtube comments according to its much more accurate filters and criteria which is super helpful for creators that implement it i am definitely going to try it and then other people can download it and run other videos through it to mass report comments on other videos and other channels now that doesn't delete those comments but hopefully the mass reporting of these types of comments can help train youtube's automatic filters to more effectively remove them will it actually work i don't know but i promise you no matter how good these community built solutions get nothing can touch the effectiveness of youtube building a fix themselves and we know that to be true because the community built solutions are amazing and the problem's still here so youtube has to do something about it now i'm not expert but i have been on youtube longer than i haven't been on youtube crazy to say that so looking at these youtube comments even though these are all pretty obviously spam comments to me clearly they're getting through the spam detection filter that youtube's built so a comment moderation tool to nuke them all would be the ideal right now like i mentioned earlier they steal the uploader's profile picture to try to be convincing but then they also make literally dozens of accounts really quickly so blocking one of them and hiding all of their past activity from the channel which works it only works for one set of spam comments that one spam account left on my last video alone like i said tons of spam there's almost 40 different accounts leaving comments and each one of them has left anywhere from 1 to 111 spam comments so as of right now you can already block certain words from appearing in the body of a youtube comment so if somebody leaves a comment with a certain word in it it will just not show up and that makes a lot of sense it works for like if someone tries to put an address or your phone number or an offensive word or any number of things that may be part of the spam flavor of the moment that you can just nix right in the bud that's super useful but like i said these bots are smart or at least the people making them are they're already adapting to that by cramming as much information as they can into the username now so not just the body of the spam comment itself so the best solution i can think of right now would be for youtube to let us ban words from user names so that right off the bat i can just ban anyone who tries to use my name in their own username it's the easiest way to stop impersonation type spam from occurring and i know it might sound messy or brute force and you might be concerned about innocent users getting caught in the crossfire hey what if someone has the same name as me but listen this is the same company that saw a fraction of users getting dislike brigaded and decided to turn off dislikes for the entire site so to me this tool seems to be not that bad and who knows maybe someday in the future youtube's ai will get advanced enough that if you make a brand new account with the same profile picture and name as the person whose videos you're commenting on and then leave a hundred comments in an hour that it'll trip something and it'll recognize it as spam and delete it but in the meantime a psa myself and other creators will never ask you for money or for a shipping address or to dms on telegram and if we do have a giveaway going out we have verified accounts and will never message you from any other account so if you click on an account and it doesn't go to our channel that's a pretty good sign okay that's it for now youtube get on it that's it thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace [Music],"dont press . on youtube | I have a solution, beside the verify check use a badge that states if you use telegram or not so if messages pop up like that people can scroll up and see if the badge is there or no and if it is they can see and verify it's your true telegram. Maybe that instead of a pointless verified check, I'm not sure the point of the check they have now or how that proves anything. Like what's it verifying? that person that stole the videos has a phone? | I'm having the issue of comments being removed by the A.I. just because it might contain a word, but it's not used in a bad way or wrong or hatful and is not necessarily bad.  For example, I was watching a video regarding police searching a house and then trying to remove a person hiding in the central air vents. I commented "" I would have used a pepper b$%b to get him out"". And it turned out the police used pepper like 1-2min later and my comment was removed. I tested by putting it back up but combining the 2 two word like pepper-b&%b and it still insta removes it, it's been happening a lot and that's lame A.I. not even near kind of good A.I....  I mean what if I was trying to say I like your homemade bath-b&%b? removed | Its getting annoying having my comments deleted, while scammers, spam, And personal attacks, get to stay.
Annoying to a stage where I am thinking of deleting my YouTube account, whats the use of having a YouTube account, when you just keep geting silenced for something harmless by dystopian Algorthims. | We need to get banned bot Comments | 9:23 YES THIS IS WHAT WE NEED

We can block ""hi, check my bio"" or ""telegram"" | Spam bots need a new hobby. Maybe knitting? 🧶 | Hi | Two years later and it has only gotten worse. Many people are falsely flagged as spammers. More and more posts are being randomly deleted without any notification or explanation. It's becoming really bad.

As a result, the community is becoming less and less involved with the channels. 😡 | There is no option to report features thatvnot work. Alike fb they create features for appearance only. Best youtube example: AUTOPLAY, you turn off so only see video went to see or show... But NEXT PLAY pops and sure enough moves on to next. And 99.9% are NOT even related to the search and watched video. Also, just like fb extreme effort in new ways for more ads. Also, block channels don't work..."
a6zvvlrd-jw,The Electric Car Pre-Order Problem,"I really want EVs to be the future, but this is getting ridiculous... MKBHD Merch: http://shop.MKBHD.com Tech I'm using right now: ...",2022-03-30T21:12:29Z,2466654,114230,6726,[Music] so tesla rolled the new roadster 2.0 off the back of a truck and unveiled all of its ridiculous specs in november of 2017 world record acceleration world record quarter mile time world record electric range this looked like the new king of performance sports cars so if you liked it you could order a founder's edition on the spot that day to be in the first thousand you just have to wire transfer the full price of the car to tesla within 10 days 250 000 but now it's 2022 and that car is still not out yet and so you just gave tesla a five-year interest-free loan of a quarter million dollars now if you just put that exact same quarter million into an investment that actually earns you money like let's say i don't know buying tesla stock with that exact dollar amount on that same day then that would be worth more than four million dollars today electric cars have a problem right now so first let me just say i firmly believe electric cars are the future i think a lot of people would agree with that but they're just that they're the future not the present so 99 of the cars on the road today are still gas cars but the problem comes from how entirely unpredictable electric car launches have been for the past like half a decade to the point where if you put your money down for one of these things you really don't know exactly what you're going to be getting or when you're going to be getting it now a big part of this is the fact that there are so many new companies trying this like the car industry is mostly huge old companies but tesla's success has convinced a lot of people they can spin up a new electric car company too with their own little twist but the thing is making new electric cars is really difficult and really expensive and starting a new electric car company is even more difficult and even more expensive so i present to you the five-step guide for creating a new electric car company today and see if you can spot which one of these steps a lot of these new startups are getting stuck at so step one make a clever name with a great idea for an electric vehicle preferably something tesla hasn't already done yet and make a snazzy website to show off this cool idea you have step two become a company you know you're going to need an enthusiastic ceo a fun company culture maybe even poach some people from other successful car companies and start making this idea look very promising step three build one prototype so this is the key so you can you can build more for bonus points but all you really got to do is make one working version of this new vehicle you know if not all the high-tech features are working that's fine you just got to demonstrate the ability to build an electric vehicle then step four you gotta take this vehicle and use it to generate as much money as possible parade it around to generate attention show it off bring it to car shows let the press try it and you gotta put a pre-order button on your website so people who like the idea can give you a little interest-free loan but more importantly you can use the number of pre-orders to get big investors interested in getting on board so you look how much promise and interest the idea has you wouldn't want to miss out on an opportunity to invest in a next big electric car company right then step five ship it use the money you raised build a factory build the technology become a car company and ship it now spoiler alert pretty much all these companies get to step four but the gap between step four and step five is massive it's like that how to draw an owl tutorial like step one draw two circles step two draw the rest of the owl but it's really hard you have all these new companies coming up and making all this interesting stuff but then not getting to the last step and that gap has created so much distrust and confusion about what to expect when you put your money down for something you know it kind of reminds me of like smartphone launches i've talked about sony before you know when apple or samsung announces a new phone it's on stage and then two weeks later it's in the stores you can buy it and then sony's problem would be you know they'd announce a new phone and it would be kind of cool but then it wouldn't come out for six months and so by the time it actually did get released all the hype was gone the interest was gone people who were thinking about spending that money on that would spend it on other things and it would it would just fall apart now people are willing to wait a little bit longer in the car industry but it's just getting kind of ridiculous so i think my earliest experience with this was with faraday future some of you might have heard of them cool name very interesting company they nailed steps one and two and they showed me a functional prototype five years ago in 2017. it was super cool they showed it to me on the ces show floor and they drove people like me around in it and even did a 0-60 in 2.39 seconds [Music] that is legit not bad right so they kind of nailed step three so then they moved on to try to generate as much money as possible you know for the factory and the engineers and everything required to ship the thing and they've been stuck in this step ever since you know they did allow pre-orders which are still open by the way you can still give faraday future one thousand five hundred dollars to pre-order the ff-91 and they even went public which helped with capital so they've raised enough money and they've put together enough to be worth about two billion dollars now and that's still not nearly enough money to have actually made the factory and shipped anything will they ever get to step five will they ever actually ship an ff91 i remember another company called biten they had a pretty cool prototype i also saw them at ces this was about four years ago and this again made a pretty big splash i remember all the headlines from the show awesome presentation their site too is full of great ideas for a pair of vehicles that are presented as very realistic and very achievable they managed to raise 1.2 billion dollars from investors but they've gone silent they haven't tweeted in two years their website hasn't changed since 2020 and they certainly haven't shipped any cars and then canoe is another one of these companies they might ship something so they were they were founded in 2017 by some ex faraday future employees they eventually got hyundai and kia to announce they'd work with them on a new electric vehicle platform they got listed on the stock exchange and valued at 2.4 billion dollars now hyundai and kia look like they've pulled out but you can still go to canoe.com and pre-order one right now if you really want to but they haven't shipped anything yet either then like a week and a half ago i got an instagram ad for a company called atlas motors that i'd never heard of and out of morbid curiosity i clicked it and it is kind of wild their home page the home page immediately promises an electric vehicle platform that will help any company electrify their lineup and then a quad motor pickup truck with up to 500 miles of range that can charge up in 15 minutes but the biggest brightest button up at the top of their website is the invest button so if you like the idea that they've shown you enough you can get in at the ground level of this crowdfunding for what might be the next big thing apparently they're already worth nearly a billion dollars so they say they're going to be using the funds for equipment and machinery and research and development and administrative expenses and you know basically making a company but when will atlas motors actually ship anything i i don't know that's a great question and if you really want to see what a failed blueprint of trying to get through these five steps looks like look at everything lordstown motors has ever done so lordstown was founded in 2018 with this nice plan to make electric pickup trucks so they'd have in-hub motors in the wheels and they'd started around 52 thousand dollars seemed like a really cool truck nice idea they'd made some nice pre-production models to parade around and gather interest from fans and potential investors you could find a lordstown endurance truck at almost every conceivable auto show which is great for people pointing cameras at it so they got to step three take people's money and so they went over to gm and bought an old plant from them which got them interested enough that gm decided to invest 75 million dollars in this promising new company they went on to open pre-orders and got over a hundred thousand pre-orders and then with all this momentum they went public as a company and their evaluation soared to over five billion dollars but then unfortunately an investigation found that most of these pre-orders were fabricated not real plus they allegedly paid a company to place around a thousand pre-orders sick this company's pretty much been falling apart ever since lordstown today is somehow still worth hundreds of millions of dollars but i don't think they're gonna be shipping anything anytime soon but then the latest startup that you might have seen in the news was rivien now rivien looked like they had all the promise in the world because not only did they have a really good idea the r1t and r1s vehicles and not only did they have a great presentation and a hungry target demographic and a cool ceo but they actually seem to be getting real money together so they had a contract from amazon they got investment from ford they were getting billions and billions of dollars together and that seemed like they might be getting enough to scrape together to jump over to step five they might finally leap to be able to ship these new vehicles you know they got one of those pre-production trucks out to our studio here and i lived with it for two days and i was very impressed i love the thing enough to put in my own pre-order it had all kinds of cool features working software and honestly it's one of my favorite evs i've driven to this point but as you know it's easy to make just one it's easy to make just one but rivian's got enough money so they had they could do the r d they could build the factory and they could finally start actually shipping some of these slowly but they're shipping some real units to real users as we speak but even rivien has had a bumpy road you know with all the capital needed to start things up plus the wrench of the pandemic and the supply chain shortages being thrown into things even they a bit underestimated how much money they would need to make these trucks for people so a few days ago rivien decided to raise the price of all their vehicles by around twelve to fifteen thousand dollars and that included all of the trucks that all those people had already preserved so they wouldn't honor the price of those old pre-orders cue massive amounts of backlash which totally understandable the truck just went from 70 something thousand to nearly 100 grand but it must have been more blowback than they were actually expecting because rivien walked that back like 24 hours later so there is still a higher price for new orders if you were to order today but they let all the people who had those old pre-orders in stay in at the low price and they offered that low price back to people who'd canceled if they could just get back in line please so even rivien isn't immune to all this chaos but they have gotten the furthest in the five-step process to the point where they're now delivering cars and they've promised i think they've projected 25 000 cars to be delivered this year for context tesla delivered about a million cars last year ford delivered about four million cars last year so i think all this highlights how hard it is to get to step five on the master plan but some of you might be thinking wait okay what if you're not a startup maybe you don't need to go through the same five-step process but still even a lot of these more established companies are treating their new electric cars like kickstarters they might not just have to do the first two steps so these days i do see some volkswagen id4s i see some mustang mock ease i see some ionics out there on the road love to see it but then there's the ford f-150 lightnings of the world which they've definitely shown off they've brought one to the studio here you can pre-order one right now and they should hopefully be starting to ship in a few months and then of course tesla an existing car company pretty much followed the exact same blueprint with the cyber truck i remember the one famous working prototype doing some fun laps around new york city you know the pre-orders climbing into the millions which again is a few hundred million dollars of interest-free loans straight to tesla still not sure when this thing's gonna ship though and then of course i did the thing that i was talking about in the beginning of the video with the roadster that was back in 2017 it's been five years since they showed that car off and who knows when it's ever gonna ship so the moral of the story beware of these companies parading around working prototypes of electric cars while also taking pre-orders with far away delivery dates or unknown ship dates just that the combination of these things you should pay attention to it i'm still going to check out new electric cars when they get announced i want to see what kind of new stuff is out there but anytime i see a new eevee announcement i'm automatically going to add a couple years and several thousand dollars no matter who it's from okay that's it for my rant let me know what you guys think of all these all these new electric car announcements we've seen over the past couple years in the comments section below we'll hang out there either way that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys later peace [Music],"Thats kikstarters are scamers , billons dollars and

UpqaQR4ikig,Does Fast Charging ACTUALLY Ruin Your Battery?,"60 watts? 120 watts? 240 watts? Here's what REALLY ruins batteries, explained. MKBHD Merch: http://shop.MKBHD.com Cable ...",2022-03-25T22:08:26Z,8612232,344350,14302,"okay so it seems like every few months a new company someone comes out with the new fastest ever charging smartphone like years ago the flagship iPhone was charging at 5 watts and that was fairly standard it would take about 2 and 1/2 hours to charge the phone from 0 to 100 then when the pixel 1 came out that was super fast charging at 18 Watts then soon the iPhone bumped up to 20 then you might remember one plus beat out everybody for a couple years with 30 Watts but soon we had 45 65 80 now today right now this xiaomi 12 Pro ships with this 120 W charger this you could you can buy this right now today it charges the whole phone from 0 to 100 in 17 minutes and then just a few weeks ago Oppo demoed this it's not on a real smartphone yet but it would charge a theoretical 240 Watts which would go from 0 to 100 in 9 minutes minutes that's pretty ridiculous and then as you may have noticed like I have pretty much anytime one of these demos gets posted somewhere universally the comments across the board are like I don't want that in my phone that definitely is going to overheat good luck plugging that in for more than 5 minutes before it explodes people across the board are universally convinced that there is no way that this can be good for your smartphone's battery which got me thinking if this is true then why would these companies keep doing this is fast charging actually ruining your battery so I dove into it I just Dove straight in plenty of Google searches plenty of articles read plenty of people talked to and plenty of hot takes out there but this is what I found so batteries have improved in their chemistry over time but right now all phones use lithium ion or Lithium Polymer batteries and the way they work is they have a positive side and a negative side and the lithium ions flow from the negative to the positive side through a liquid electrolyte solution and as they flow energy is released into the circuit that's what's keeping the phone powered by the battery when that flow is over though the battery has reached 0% and it's dead so charging the battery back up is moving those ions back through from the positive to the negative side through that electrolyte solution so the first thing to know about charging a battery is batteries are kind of like a sponge like they they absorb the most energy when they have the least in them and then as they get closer and closer to full they can't absorb quite as efficiently and then there is some excess lost with a sponge it's just extra water passing through with a battery that's just excess heat and so what that looks like is charging actually happens on a curve those numbers that you keep seeing with the 100 watts and 150 watt fast charging that's not the constant rate of charging that's just the peak the maximum that they're capable of but that's typically only briefly the actual rate so a 65 wat fast charger for example will typically only hit 65 Watts for the first few minutes pretty early on in the charge from low battery and then take paper off and basically only trickle charge at a lower wattage after around 80% and you can actually view that if you get one of these incredibly nerdy cables with the display on it that lets you see exactly how much power your phone is accepting while you're charging I'll link one of them below the like button but then the second thing to know is batteries do degrade over time the iPhone as you've probably seen lets you literally visualize it it shows you the percentage so if you go to settings and battery and battery health you can see your iPhone's degradation rating as a number from 1 to 100 so this 13 Pro I've been using is still good for 97% of the capacity it had when I got it 5 months ago so why does it go down is the real question we're trying to answer and turns out there are several things that degrade batteries I mean these are they're picky little things they're very energy dense little storage units they don't like being at 100% exactly they don't like being at 0% and they do naturally degrade over time as they go through charge cycles and the ions pass through that electrolyte solution over and over again slowly breaking it down this is totally natural and can't really be avoided as you charge the phone more and more but the number one factor that damages batteries that degrades them faster than normal that ruins your battery is heat so the ions are moving through that electrolyte a lot but you can think of the electrolyte basically like salts so they can be pretty sensitive to changes in heat they can actually crystallize and clog up the anodes and cathodes which stops them from being able to store store the lithium ions and like I mentioned earlier when the battery isn't in the optimal state of charge it's less efficient and that extra runoff energy manifests as heat heat is no good so clearly the goal here is to minimize any excess heat around that battery which would damage it faster than normal now the thing is generally the more wattage the more power you're pumping into this battery the more heat it's going to generate so it sounds like this extra fast charging is clearly bad for your phone it's more heat generated and it's bad degradation but that's not something these companies aren't thinking about so over the years a bunch of these different smartphone companies have basically been working on trying to figure out how to charge these phones as fast as possible without generating any extra heat like if you look at just xiaomi's page for their fast charging alone there's tons of charts and graphs and claims about what they're doing to get around this so one new advancement came from one plus when they dropped that warp charge 30t charger it's kind of interesting and a little confusing maybe that we had warp charge 30 and warp charge 30t and both were 30 Watts but 30t was faster but this is because with 30t the power management got handled in the brick instead of in the phone so there was more heat produced by the brick in the wall instead of on the phone near the battery so OnePlus could put the same amount of power into the phone but for a longer period of time without heating it up as much and so the charging curve could be improved like this so that's a nice step the down side there is we're now we're getting larger power bricks but that's a bit of a trade-off people are willing to make I guess but then another way we've seen a bunch of companies jump on especially lately is with something called parallel charging so basically instead of putting a ton of power into a single battery they actually split up the battery into two cells next to each other and then add power management Hardware to split the incoming power this is a simple but brilliant way to get faster charging times without a ton of heat imagine instead of trying to pump 50 watts into a single 5,000 mAh battery just doing 25 watts into two batteries of half the size that's going to generate way less heat it's only 25 watts but combined when you draw the curves you can achieve the equivalent of 50 wat charging and you get to put 50 Watts on the box but it's with way less heat but again there's a downside to this method too which is a slightly smaller overall battery capacity because if you take the same internal volume of two batteries instead of one that means there's more space taken up by the boundary between the batteries and the housing and that charging management Hardware I mentioned so you'll often end up with slightly smaller overall batteries if they're split like this and then of course something we've seen in just about every new phone coming out which doesn't really have a downside is just adding more cooling Hardware onto the phone itself sometimes that's heat shields and Vapor Chambers sometimes it's a a whole fan but specifically we're trying to get the parts inside from getting too hot it feels like every smartphone announcement for the past two to three years has some sort of section about cooling especially gaming phones you're of course cooling the system on a chip too but the better the cooling system overall the more power you can put into the phone without it getting too hot so the real question is is it working like is it is it that simple you can just as long as you keep the phone cool enough you can put as much power into it as you want well there are the downsides I mentioned earlier with the larger brick and maybe the phone's got to be thicker with more Cooling and has a smaller capacity battery but the question we're trying to ask is what counts as ruining your battery that's a simple one and it turns out there's actually an industry standard for this so from the research I've done and the people at these companies I've talked to the generally accepted Target goal is 80% battery health after 800 charges so let's say you charge your phone roughly once a day that'll pan out to about 2 years so 80% charge after 2 years so this iPhone now that I'm at 97% after about 5 months is on track to be at roughly 85% after 2 years which that's pretty good that's above the industry standard officially not being ruined now for all these super fast Chargers that are new well it's tough cuz they're new so they've just come out and we don't have long-term data and it sucks that the only information I can use is just coming straight from those companies so I'm basically taking their word for it that yeah the fast charging doesn't ruin the phone over time but it's the best information we have and it is actually Sur surprisingly impressive so from their test results xiaomi on their site say that their 120 W charging Tech is rated to maintain 80% battery health after 800 charge cycles apple on their site they don't have the fastest charging but they say 80% after just 500 charges but like I said it seems like they're outperforming their own claims hey under promise overd deliver and then Oppo and OnePlus who've announced they'll have a 150 wat charging phone this year say that they've specifically stated it'll go 80% battery health after 1,600 Cycles so that will outperform the industry standard which I guess means they have room to keep going up now don't get me wrong the trade-offs are very real not everybody wants a thicker phone or a larger power brick or a slightly smaller capacity battery but from where I'm sitting and from the test results that we can go by basically fast charging does not have to ruin your battery life and really the best part that is just convenience on top of the fact that these companies are all actively still working on making this stuff better you might have heard about gallium nitride chargers there's a couple actually out there already in the market that allows the brick to actually be much smaller than the typical silicon Chargers we're all using now so you can do a 65 wat gallium nitride charger half the size and still put the same power into the phone but really what it comes down to these days is it's called a smartphone for a reason batteries these days are smart like modern phones all have tons of hardware and sensors inside the phone to help measure temperature and regulate charging so it's doing all kinds of stuff automatically and then the phones all will add a bunch of software features on top to help you actively maintain the battery to the nth degree plus you know phones like the Rog phone 5 have pass through charging so when you're plugged in and gaming which is typically not a good idea on a regular phone it can just power the system and it doesn't add charge to the battery at all so you're not putting extra stress and heat on the battery and it can maintain battery health for a lot longer the latest iPhones and pixels 2 right now have a feature where if you plug in at night around the same time every night after a few days it learns when you wake up so instead of charging right to 100% when you plug it in it charges up to 80 then Waits all the way until you're about to wake up maybe an hour before your alarm and then charges the rest of the way up to 100 so you wake up with a full battery but better health and pretty much any other phone with this super fast charging coming up is going to have to have a suite of battery health options that you can mess with in the software to take your battery health protection to the next level so I don't know how fast these phones charging is is going to get in the next couple years inevitably it's just going to keep getting better as the company's work on it but what I can tell you is the best thing we can do for our phones is to just use them like normal and basically don't give them any extra reason to get hot you know leaving it in the dash of your car on a sunny day gaming wall plugged in for long periods of time stuff like that if you can avoid your phone getting super hot you're doing the best thing you can for your battery and these smartphone companies all know that battery problems are bad news so if they're all doing their jobs then we should all be good fun fact the famous Galaxy Note 7 battery exploding issue as crazy as it was it wasn't actually due to fast charging or overheating it was actually just them with their battery supplier getting some Dimensions wrong and some bending going on of the battery with the positive and negative sides up in the corners something to think about either way now you have the answer thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace","Va falloir changer ton matos | I own a RedMagic 10 Pro. While some people don't like gaming phones, I do like how it has two separate batteries, and a fan that keeps the batteries cool while it's charging. While the phone is capable of 100 watts peak charging, they played it safe and only included an 80 watt brick inside the box. | Great video.  I love what OnePlus has been doing.  Just got the 13 and the charging capability is incredible.  I was hoping you'd mention the new battery type it used but then I saw the age of the video. | Mobilerepairbd | I super charged my Oneplus 13 with the massive power brick just the once. The phone still became a bit too hot for my taste. It would be a corporate interest that we wreck our batteries for quick turnaround. Back to regular charging from now on. Why such the rush anyway. FYI (Oppo - and Oneplus are owned by the same Chinese parent company) Thanks. | 1:25 besides the reality of the situation, companies would do this because of planned obsolescence. Batteries die faster due to superior technology and convenience, means they can charge more for the power supply and for phones dying faster. | Yes. | That delayed charging feature was on Huawei phones from 5 years ago. Have this on my mate 20x5g. And my wife's p30 has that feature. Good to see as always Samsung and apple spearhead the push for new tech and Innovation 😂 | Go back to the removable battery, replace your battery after 2 years, da ta. | How can we keep up with the count? I just use it and charge it 😅"
yoigsHYc77s,&quot;The Apple Studio Display is a Bad Deal&quot;,Apple's Studio Display is quite an oddball in 2022... That shirt! http://shop.MKBHD.com Tech I'm using right now: ...,2022-03-22T21:38:26Z,5626625,158858,10128,"[Music] all right so for the past 3 years the cheapest and only display that Apple's made has been the $5,000 Pro display xdr which would cost an extra $1,000 on top just for the matte finish and another $1,000 just for the stand so when this new studio display got announced you know it's a very apple design it's a 27in 5k screen surrounded by all these little apple bells and whistles and with the stand included for 1,600 bucks a lot of Apple Fans were understandably very happy but then after the dust of the announcement settled a lot of us found ourselves asking wait a second is this actually a good deal so now I've been using this display for about 2 weeks now and I have an answer for you but I need you to understand how I'm getting there so for most people who are not interested and we're never going to buy this screen anyway the is it worth it conversation basically comes down to the spec sheet and just comparing it with all other similar displays it's like when you go to buy a house and the appraisal just goes and looks at square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms and materials used and proximity and comes up with a price based on what other houses with the same sort of specs are going for so this new studio display it's 27 in diagonally 5K resolution 600 nits brightness it's a IPS LCD at 60 HZ with P3 color it's got a webcam up top it's got some speakers at the bottom some USBC C ports on the back and it's $1,600 so if I was an appraiser looking for a comparable house I would be looking at the LG ultra fine 5K that is also a 27in 5k IPS LCD it's at 500 nits also at 60 HZ with P3 color a webcam some speakers and some USBC ports on the back that's $1,300 but it's also 5 years old and while there are not that many other 5K displays out there there are a ton of 4K screens and one of those would be the Dell ultr sharp u2720q that is also a 27in IPS LCD panel with thinner bezels also at 60 htz and also with P3 color and some ports around the back super well reviewed $589 so if you just go by the specs of the panel it's actually pretty clear that this display and the tech you're getting for the price is a B deal but the second you're actually considering buying a display you realize it's not just the display specs of the panel that make or break the experience it's all the stuff that surrounds the screen for someone actually considering using it and Apple products they just have a habit of doing this thing where they don't have the best specs on paper but they offer a unique combination of things that make it really hard to do any sort of onetoone comparison because nobody else has that exact unique combination of things things like you know how they make up the most cherry-picked stats in NBA media like oh this guy just became the third player ever to get a triple double before his 26th birthday after eating Apple Jacks for breakfast that morning or like wow there's only five players to play 800 games enjoying the 13.5 5.9 1.4 4930 Club anyway that's how it feels talking about this monitor so first of all it's 5K not 4K and like I said there's tons of 4K monitors out there but this one is 5K for a reason it's basically the same panel from the 27in iMac which many people including myself really liked even though it's quite old so it's sitting at a solid 218 pixels per inch and it also benefits from being exactly twice the vertical and horizontal resolution of 2560 X 1440 so scaling is super clean and everything looks sharper as a result and then as far as single backlight LCDs go it's pretty solid it's got bumped up to 600 nits which is plenty fine indoors as long as you're not near any windows I have not had any issues worse than normal with ghosting or light bleed as you see with some LCDs but obviously it's nowhere near something like a mini LED display with separate backlight zones that can do really good HDR and then this one I've been testing is the nanotexture version which is a $300 upgrade it's extremely good at killing Reflections and it's impressive that it's this good good for 300 bucks when the same treatment on the pro display was 1,000 bucks but honestly I still probably wouldn't recommend it unless you literally work with a window like right behind you or something because the version without n texture is always going to be slightly sharper and punchier and much easier to clean but speaking of upgrades this monitor which has the stand permanently attached so you know it's included which is nice but uh it has height adjustment which is cool right it's it's nice but the the base version doesn't have that and so this just just the ability to adjust height is a $400 upgrade to this stand so the version without high adjustment is a little bit low and I think a lot of people started to notice that and you know the IMAX didn't have hide adjustment but just for a monitor this expensive to have to spend $400 extra dollars to be able to do this seems kind of ridiculous even though you can go to an Apple store if you do get buyers or Morse and have them add it after the fact but if you do it's a really solid stand all metal perfectly balanced and spring-loaded to hold the panel firmly in place it's actually more sturdy in my experience than the pro display xdr mostly because it doesn't have to rotate and just the overall build quality of this monitor is top of the line it is built so well and of course this will never show up on the spec sheet and this isn't even something traditionally that matters all that much with a monitor something you don't touch you know a phone you want to be built well things you hold and carry but this is just going to sit on your desk but they went over the top with the build quality the overall design aesthetic so in a world of basically all plastic monitors this one's Full Metal Jacket sharp Corners the Precision drilled perforations at the top for ventilation all of it kind of is in a class of its own and I love it they left enough room inside for a power supply to be built in so there's no power brick or wall wart this is probably the best looking and Best Built monitor out right now now of course yes you'd have to really care about something like that to spend extra on it if it's just going to sit on your desk but there also is a catch and it's a really weird weird decision but the power cable is not removable I mean when you look back here it's a black plastic Circle that looks like it should be removable and it turns out if you pull really hard you can actually rip it out the back but it's pretty clear it's not designed to be removed by the user this is from the same company that designed a new mag safe connector for the new iMac this is a super baffling Choice turns out there's a special tool required to remove the studio display properly I don't count that as user removable we've all seen what a normal removable monitor cable looks like but now instead it's kind of in this homepod situation where like it's clearly not meant to be user removed and so now if the cable does get damaged at all if you run a wheel over it or pet shoes on it or something you have to send the whole thing back to get repaired thumbs down now Above This panel is is a 12 megap ultrawide camera with center stage and triple microphones all powered by a literal a13 bionic chip for those who remember correctly that's the same chip that powered the entire iPhone 11 now while this is basically the same webcam Hardware as the new iPad Air it looks substantially worse like it's just flat and grainy all the time in any lighting I throw at it maybe I just got my hopes up too high I mean I knew it would be softer because it's it's cropping into a 12 megapixel ultrawide frame so there's less pixels I knew it wouldn't have shallowed up the field or anything it's not a big sensor but I mean the mics sound pretty good as you can hear but it there's just no Shadows it refuses to let anything dark actually look dark which for me is not great apple is actually promising a software update that may help things imagine that a software update for a monitor apparently it has 64 gigs of onboard storage for some reason but yeah bottom line is it's it's convenient that there's a webcam built in but there's definitely still a market for like an opal C1 type webcam the stuff that looks way better than this but then there are the speakers so they're all situated in the bottom of the monitor here there are six total four Force cancelling woofers and two tweeters they say it's the best computer speakers they've ever shipped in any of their systems and it's true it's 100% true this thing I've compared it to the 16-in MacBook Pro these are substantially louder they f fill a room if you want it to they can create a somewhat convincing Dolby at most surround setup if you want it's it's really good so for built-ins they are above and beyond the rest they don't sound as good as dedicated speakers but if you really want good built-in speakers then yeah if you're into that these do it by the way Apple should just make speakers right I mean the homepod doesn't count they should right they should just make speakers so anyway if you want a monitor for the panel quality and the panel quality alone then there are lots of others just like this for way less money but if you're one of the surprisingly large group of people who were waiting for a monitor that would work really well in this apple ecosystem World Of Products then this is just what you've been waiting for it's pretty much made to be used with the new Mac Studio hence the name I also plugged into the MacBook Pro which charges the laptop at 96 Watts but hilariously I I really just didn't think it was that great of pair I mean it looks great next to it but the MacBook Pro has a much brighter higher refresh rate mini LED display that just looks way better to me and was preferable for me to use so I just ended up wanting to use the promotion of the laptop screen all the time but then you know just for fun you can plug it into an iPad and it works perfectly normally mirrors and charges the iPad and we also plugged into a PC and it worked like a normal monitor at full 5K resolution and it does actually use the speakers and the webcam but without any of the processing or Center Stage that comes from lighting up that a13 what an odd combination of parts for real honestly for nearly $2,000 if you just close your eyes and say okay it's 2022 and apple is going to make a studio display you'd expect mini LED maybe or maybe promotion or maybe it might have face ID or a good webcam or just any combination of those things things instead it has none and a non- removable power cable and a nonuser upgradeable stand it's odd that is a rare swing in a Miss for me someone who works in a studio but the real question the real question is is the studio display a good deal or not well is the Rolls-Royce Ghost a good deal because it's the only four-door sedan with suicide doors and a 6.7 L V12 for under $400,000 does that make it a good deal or how about are the Nike Hyper adaps a good deal because they are the cheapest best self-lacing shoes you can get right now for $350 does that make him a good deal I guess what I'm trying to say is maybe it doesn't really matter if it's a good deal or not if it's exactly what you want like if there are other cheaper options it doesn't really really matter cuz there's only one that does the exact thing that you wanted to and so that's what this is for some people you're probably just going to want to get this one but yeah now it's not a good deal [Music]","There is genuinely no reason to buy this 'monitor'. You can't arm mount it, it's not even oled, the difference between 5k and 4k is completely unnoticable, it's only 60hz and it's so much more expensive than real monitors that literally do everything this can't and better for cheaper. There's good Apple products, and there's bad apple products, the sad reality is that people will buy it regardless because it has the apple logo on it. This is honestly criminal for any tech product, especially for Apple's standards. Do better, Apple. | I'll never understand why ANYONE buys an expensive Apple monitor with a permanently attached stand of any kind instead of a VESA mount adapter. You can then attach whatever stand you like to it, tilt and height adjustable, or mount it to a table. | 1000 for a stand, hell no its not worth it. Like are we just going to gloss over that... | this is best monitor I ever had, and I had a lot of top shit in my life. | Such a scam company apple and it doesn't get called out enough for it. Their prices far exceed the quality of their products. It's not rational, or it's rational if they want to make it a status thing. | Anyone else find that non-marketed 64GB storage in a monitor with a webcam and an entire phone processor just a lil sus? I'm not a ""big brother is watching"" kinda guy, buuuuut.... | 5k is twice as good as 4k | YOU'RE NOT A GOOD DEAL BRO! | I just found this video again. It might be a bad deal price wise, but it's freaking gorgeous on my desk and I don't regret the purchase one bit ... :D | Dough tech spectrum higher frame rate is only 4K tho but you can get it with a matte finish for 1k"
wvhP1al3Ur4,Mac Studio Review: Double Trouble!,"This M1 Ultra machine is incredible, but I'm not switching YET M1 Max MacBook Pro review: https://youtu.be/rr2XfL_df3o BluDot ...",2022-03-18T21:35:13Z,4122578,136864,4739,[Music] welcome to the review of the MAC at the studio I mean welcome to the review of the Mac Studio [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right so this is the computer I personally got really excited about when they announced it because we've built a video Studio here and this computer is literally called the Mac Studio so the entire purpose is to be the ideal computer that is small and powerful enough to be in a studio environment and had all these example studios in the Apple event from music studios to Design Studios to specifically video Studios and so they made a little Cube the size of Two and a Half Mac minis with a bunch of i o some new Cooling and an M1 Max or an M1 Ultra chip inside specifically to live in these Studio environments and so now I've got one here in our studio so I've been throwing all types of tasks and projects and accessories at this thing including this new studio display which I also plan on making a separate review about because it's pretty weird make sure you get subscribed for that and I actually have two but I've mostly been putting my time into testing this M1 Ultra version because it's the newest biggest baddest chip so I call this the 2x machine basically everything about this machine is doubled now I'm going to be referring to the M1 Max chip a lot during this review so if you haven't already seen the MacBook Pro review with the M1 Max chip in it that's going to be very helpful I'll leave that link below the like button this one basically doubles all the things so physically speaking it's basically like two Mac minis stacked on top of each other melted into one thick Mac Mini three C's and this is incredibly small for the amount of power it puts out it can sit on any desk alongside speakers or a monitor or whatever you set it up with also it is a total coincidence but I set mine up on this desk I got from Blue Dot which already has a bunch of these perforated holes that remind me of the mac and it fits absolutely perfectly underneath the shelf so that a monitor can sit on top of the Shelf without actually sitting on top of the computer anyway this is the back of the computer which has a full Suite of i o even more ports than the Mac Mini there are four Thunderbolt 4 ports a 10 gigabit Ethernet port the power plug two usb-a ports an HDMI 2.0 Port not 2.1 again for some reason and a headphone jack that can support higher impedance headphones just like the MacBook Pro now it's not kicking out world-class audio by any means it's not going to replace my universal audio DAC but it is convenient to have kind of the same way HDMI is convenient although I'm kind of surprised this one doesn't do HDMI 2.1 I get it on the laptop that's just so you can plug in a random monitor on the go but this is going to sit at your desk and it would be nice to have high refresh rate but at the same time the Ford Thunderbolt ports will support up to four Pro display xdrs which are all 6K so I guess he got back on for you but then at the front Halo look look at that front i o which is nice because this is going to sit on a desk not under it so up front here that's going to be two USBC ports if you get the base M1 Max version but those graduate to two Thunderbolt 4 ports if you get the M1 Ultra version because there's literally more buses available and then an SD card slot because every Studio I know has tons of SD cards lying around somewhere so it turns out if I wanted to replace my Mac Pro today that is enough I O for me to actually do that so I've got two Thunderbolt displays and then one Thunderbolt raid array and the DAC the universal audio DAC is also Thunderbolt so all together plus a couple card readers I'd be set now Apple did use the word modularity in their presentation I don't know if that word means what they think it means I mean maybe if they're just trying to say because it's not connected to a display and you can choose your own unlike the iMac that's what they're considering modular if not then I have no idea what they're talking about because this thing is absolutely not modular at all all of the parts inside are soldered in there is no upgrading of the Ram or the GPU or any parts of this thing ever for the entire lifetime of the machine I'm not even sure there's any reasonable way to actually open up and get into the Mac Studio so yeah I can't give you modular on this one apple but also this level of vertical integration is basically required to get a computer to be this small and this efficient like I've seen some small PCS before this one is Tiny also the power supply is built in so there's no wall wart it's all just in this little box and also fun fact Apple did send both the M1 Max and M1 Ultra versions here to the studio to test and the M1 Ultra version is in fact notice possibly heavier than the max it's two whole pounds heavier it turns out that's because the heatsink they used in the ultra version is made of copper instead of the aluminum one they put in the M1 Max it's much more dense it's heavier that's pretty serious but I think that's my cue to talk about the inside of this machine a little bit more because that's where the 2x theme starts up again so you remember the event the M1 Ultra is literally two M1 Maxes basically fused together with a high enough bandwidth between them to behave like one huge mega chip which is awesome because that means two times the CPU cores two times the GPU cores two times the memory bandwidth and two times the total memory so in applications I can take advantage of this stuff well this should be twice the machine now Apple did the whole thing they always do with graphs and you know you can never really take these completely at face value I did do some synthetic benchmarks though and for a lot of them it does behave like twice the computer it it absolutely blew the doors off every other Mac ever made especially including the iMac Pro and it even flirts with the 28 core cheese grater Mac Pro that I've been using so in geekbench it ties the highest single core score I've ever seen and then it drops a multi-core score literally double the M1 Max MacBook Pro and yes that also makes it more powerful in the CPU Department than any other Mac ever including 28 core Mac Pro then in the cinebench test which I think is a little more realistic ran it for 10 minutes and it gave me around 24 000 which again is about double the M1 Max and is right in line between a 16 core thread Ripper and a high thread count Xeon chip like the Mac Pro basically the CPU benchmarks are killer until could never but then we got to talk about GPU stuff it gets a little more interesting so you might remember Apple's graphs were comparing at one point the ultra to an RTX 3090 they kept saying it'll have the same performance as an RTX 3090 but at 200 Watts less power and that's very impressive but it turns out the graph should continue a little something like this because the RTX 3090 will happily continue to draw way more power up to 400 watts of power it's one of the power hungriest cards ever so shout out to heimgartenberg at The Verge for this chart inspiration so it turns out it doesn't beat the RTX 3090 at anything that you would buy an RTX 3090 for which I didn't really expect it to because that card is almost exclusively for gaming like you buy that to play games and you would never buy this to play games but hey double the cores still do double the work so on geekbench's metal Benchmark which measures GPU performance with things like image processing I got nearly double the score of the M1 Max MacBook Pro cracking a hundred thousand which is around what a Radeon Pro Vega 2 Duo in my Mac Pro scores but the Mac Pro has four of them now synthetic benchmarks are cool and everything but you don't buy a computer like this to just try to get the highest benchmark scores you buy a new computer to see if that new power can translate to real world performance and real world workflows and so basically what I've noticed most is the more well-optimized the app the closer you get to those 2x performance numbers nothing really typically hits exactly 2x but the M1 Ultra does feel faster a bit sometimes than the M1 Max I mean in everyday performance just zipping around the Mac yeah this thing slaps it makes me really wish I had a high refresh rate monitor here that plays nicely with the Mac because that would actually feel way more responsive like the MacBook Pro with its Pro motion screen but you know 5000 plus megabytes per second read write speeds from the drive things open instantly it's great and then in my own workflow you might know by now I'm a Final Cut Pro editor here it did give me more Headroom and it did perform better than the M1 Max MacBook Pro but again it didn't quite beat the Mac Pro I'm currently using basically it's gotten to the point where I can drop fresh 8K raw files on the timeline in better quality playback mode immediately hit play and start tweaking color and messing with raw settings and it plays back perfectly at 30 frames without hesitation minimal lag when I hit the play button I love it it's when you start adding layers of objects and plugins and animations and trackers on top that things do start to slow down and I can still bring it to its knees with enough layers of moving objects like I had I had six at the beginning of the iPad Air review but then when I got to the export at the end of the video it took the Mac Studio 7 minutes and 30 seconds to export my iPhone SE review which is pretty impressive but interestingly this same project took 6 minutes and five seconds to export from the Mac Pro so it's still more powerful it just has more raw horsepower but of course not everybody's using Apple's own apps like I do with Final Cut there are plenty of Premiere Studios there are lots of DaVinci Resolve Studios hell even in this studio we've got people using heavy Photoshop and after effects stuff for thumbnails and Motion Graphics so I am happy to report that adobe has been working through their Suite the newest After Effects beta is dramatically faster on Apple silicon so that's awesome and I'm gonna link an article from Scott Simmons where he went through a bunch of tests between Premiere and resolve comparing the M1 Ultra with the M1 Max and you can see a consistent performance improvement with all the heavier stuff like adding warp stabilizer rendering a heavy clip Etc the only thing I did find where the M1 Ultra didn't beat the M1 Max was interestingly just a straight up prores video export sorry for the tons of video comparisons but hey it's a video studio so this was one area where it did smoke the Mac Pro because the new prores the media engines in these Apple silicon products are great the M1 Ultra has literally double the media engine of the M1 Max so I thought it would be twice as fast while they both beat the Mac Pro it was roughly the same time to export a single prores clip but generally yeah it might not have matched the Mac Pro at every single little thing I threw at it but yeah if you're not a video person I'll let you find The Benchmark that applies best to your workflow but generally with the stuff I threw at it M1 Ultra heavily outperformed M1 Max and it did it all very quietly with very little heat in this tiny little box that just sits inconspicuously on your desk I mean this computer makes it so obvious why they were eager to ditch Intel also let me give a shout out to the sustainability element here too so they use recycled materials inside these computers that's cool and then even the packaging I don't think people understand how hard this is the packaging for these computers is absolutely incredible fully recyclable lots of padding moving parts and then with a literal floating cardboard platform in the middle for shock absorption it's wild I would not be surprised if just this box added like 50 bucks to the price of the computer just to engineer such a ridiculous package but as far as real world impact the biggest chunk of that will come from the efficiency of these chips of course Apple says that it'll use over a thousand kilowatt hours less energy per year than an average PC desktop that's good for your electricity bill but that's also good for the environment but at the end of the day look this is just a tool right just like the app or program you're using already is just a tool and so I think people look for the The Benchmark that will prove that this machine will make them better at what they do it can't do that like just because it's fast if you're bad at editing and you get this machine you'll still be bad at editing but just faster but I am really happy to see new machines like this still coming out that do make big leaps in performance and capability sort of raises the ceiling for what you can do now all that being said the Apple silicon Mac Pro is still coming and I say that not even like as a warning to most people but just to remind myself because honestly most workflows are covered with the Mac Studio like if I today if I'm a YouTuber and I'm just editing 4K or 8K even prores all the time this will be able to handle it but if you're doing large 3D modeling projects or tons of tracking and layers and after effects or even in audio projects lots of plugins and video stuff if you're really pushing the limits of your machine the Mac Pro platform still does offer the most horsepower so I mean it shouldn't it shouldn't be surprising that the current 40 pound 28 core you know 768 gig of RAM Mac Pro manages to slightly outperform this little tiny box here but when we do get the new Apple silicon Mac Pro I do expect performance to double this one up again which is crazy to say out loud but for everyone else this thing is overkill and I love that that's the narrative around this computer like do you really need that much power probably not but hey at least it's five thousand dollars of Overkill versus 25 000 of Overkill so it's a bargain either way that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace [Music],"""Modularity"" for Mac means that an item works with some part that is NOT permanently soldered into it... And don't argue with that because Mac knows better than the poor suckers that are getting screwed and fleeced by them (also known as ""customers"" or ""macaddicts"") 🤣🤣🤣 | I'm might grab one, I'll probably have to replace it in 3 years huh? | iMovie is still slow at editing my seven minute video clips 😂 no joke. | Why don't you give any realtime review of working with these machines. Graphs and tests are not for us | One of the worst product ever.🤮🤮just build a superior custom built pc with windows 💪 | Why people buy mac studio ?

pwHNannxolo,iPad Air M1 Review: Don&#39;t Choose Wrong!,iPad Air 5 adds one more huge feature the iPad Pro already had. Let's talk about it! The Myth of Fair Value: ...,2022-03-16T13:01:10Z,6694854,177327,5107,[Music] hey what's up um here okay there's a book called the myth of fair value and in that book it's all about pricing strategies for different products and things like that and in that there's a study that they go over about purchasing patterns so in test number one a company selling a product offers a regular option and a premium option and four out of five people pick the more premium one so then in test number two they added a third cheaper option to see if they could maybe increase revenue by looping in an audience that's looking for a cheaper lowest possible price turned out the cheapest option was kind of just ignored but it completely flipped the ratio of standard to premium purchases because now people would assume that the middle one was the appropriate value so then in test number three they took away the cheap option but then added an ultra premium option over the top and this ended up flipping the ratio right back to the original premium one but also some portion of people just went with the more expensive one just because that's what they want and so this ended up with the highest overall revenue generated pricing ladders are very real and very much designed to get you to spend as much as possible and make those companies as much money as they can this is the new 2022 ipad air with the new m1 chip inside you can tell because it's a nice shiny deeper blue color it's nice but it is one of the stranger apple products that i've seen in a long time because of its price and where it sits in the lineup because it kind of messes with the ladder a little bit so look it's actually very simple to understand what you're getting here with this spec bump which is an even more powerful version of the ipad we already know i already reviewed the 2020 ipad air and i'll link that below the like button so you already know what you're getting on the outside and then i've already reviewed several computers with the m1 chip including the ipad pro with this m1 so you know what you're getting on the inside too this is a thin 11 inch tablet same exact dimensions as the last ipad air so those cases all still work your single camera on the back usb type c at the bottom the touch id fingerprint reader in the power button up in the corner and the 11 inch 60 hertz display up front running the exact same ipad os as every other ipad the reason it's so strange is this is the most i've ever seen one apple product seem to overlap another that other product being the ipad pro so the last ipad air was already very close to the ipad pro right it had basically the same dimensions same exact camera same battery life and the same software features of all the other most expensive ipads it works with the same 2nd gen apple pencil it's just as thin in my review i called it the one true ipad pro killer because it's 80 of the tablet for 200 less dollars and so this year now that the new ipad air also gets the incredible massively overkill new m1 chip inside it's one more thing that they do exactly the same so the ipad air starts at 5.99 and the 11 inch ipad pro starts at 7.99 but let's take a closer look at this pricing see this is a pricing ladder after all so it's designed to have something available at every price and then every time you arrive at one price there's something a little higher to try to nudge you up and try to get you as high in that ladder as they can so the base price ipad air is only a 64 gigabyte ipad for 600 bucks in 2022 that's not really great i mean we got 20 gig games today so of course the only available storage option is straight up to 256 gigs which is 150 extra dollars so now you're playing in the 750 territory which is a lot of money to spend on an air when for just fifty dollars more you can get a pro right so now you might as well just bump up to the ipad pro so you can see what they're doing right they're nudging you up a little bit by a little bit but the thing is the ipad pro is more expensive but it's almost the same tablet in so many ways so they're already practically the same dimensions to the point where the ipad air works in all the same cases and keyboards that the ipad pro works in they're the same primary camera on the back the same usb c port the same battery life and now the same m1 chip so you'd have to think extra hard about spending extra money on an ipad pro when the list of reasons to do so is smaller than ever before now as someone who's used both tablets honestly one of those reasons is pretty huge and then the rest are all pretty minor but let's just go through each of them so the only reason i still pick an ipad pro as a better overall experience a better tablet than the air is the pro motion display so they're about the same size and resolution but the faster 120hz refresh rate is one of those things that just makes everything about using the pro smoother and snappier and more responsive and that's the thing that makes the m1 chip in this ipad air so funny which is it theoretically closes the gap in performance versus the pro with you know rendering and exporting and compiling and things like that but it does not feel as fast because of the 60 hertz so those big animations where your hand moves across the entire screen the unlock animation the multitasking gestures the big stuff like that you could put a 30 90 in here and it wouldn't feel as smooth as the pro motion ipad now sure some people need to see them side by side and even then they barely see a difference in which case yeah that person should just get the ipad air but i'm telling you for me if you're like me that's something i would spend the extra money for but then the ipad pro has one extra camera the 10 megapixel ultra wide plus a lidar scanner and a flash the ipad air just has a single camera no flash so you know for the occasional video call or document scanning that's totally fine for me and like i said it's the same main camera as the ipad pro so there isn't even a quality difference here then the ipad pro has quad speaker audio instead of the dual speakers of the ipad air they're both very solid speakers and it's definitely a bit fuller and louder from the pro but that's not something you're going out and spending extra money on specifically and then the pro has a higher max storage so you can go up to 2 terabytes instead of just 256 gigs and the usb-c port is thunderbolt on the pro instead of just faster usbc on the air so that might open up some potential peripheral options for actual pros plugging in drives etc and then of course you have face id on the ipad pro where you've got the touch id fingerprint reader on the ipad air honestly at this point it's kind of preference like you get used to having face id on the tablet very quickly when you have it but also the good old-fashioned two fingers registered on the ipad air works really well too so in portrait it's the right index finger that unlocks and then in landscape it's the left index finger great you know what's funny though the only other update to the air besides the m1 chip being inside is the selfie camera is now the ultra wide with center stage so it's got the newer selfie camera and it's convenient it follows you around the room it's kind of in an awkward location but it's decently smooth with face time zoom calls etc but because the ipad pro has the face id sensors and stuff technically only that older selfie camera will support animojis and memojis and things like that so there's that but that's basically it right that's the differences so now hearing that list you probably already know if you would be tempted to move up one more rung on that ladder you know maybe 50 extra bucks for promotion does it for you like it does it for me or maybe you just want a larger tablet because you do have the 13 inch ipad pro with mini led if you're tempted to go large but other than that you know the extra camera lidar the face id the speakers all pretty minor things but then the funniest part usually right the ladders are designed to try to nudge you up to try to get you to spend more and more money putting one of the features from the more expensive model in the less expensive model just removes one reason to upgrade and may actually encourage a small number of people to move down because now that theoretical person who would have spent the extra money to get the hugely improved processing power of the m1 now just has one less reason to get the pro they can get it in the air well that is until the m2 version comes out anyway either way it's fascinating it's always interesting to see these new products come out at these different various price ranges i think in that example from the beginning of the video you know apple clearly has a baseline ipad an ipad air and an ipad pro and most people don't need to spend the extra money to get the most premium ipad pro i think the promotion is enough just for me and a lot of people would too but there's also going to be a bunch of people that just spend the extra money just because they want the most premium thing fine but this ipad air is another great spec bump that actually makes me even more frustrated that ipad os is not evolving to fully take advantage of it but that's a another rant for another video

QpbGctuHoMY,iPhone SE (2022) Review: Old Dog. New Trick.,"iPhone SE = Special Edition, but really the formula is very simple... MKBHD Merch: http://shop.MKBHD.com Tech I'm using right ...",2022-03-14T13:00:48Z,4475704,146275,10108,"all right what's up MKBHD here and here it is this is the new 2022 iPhone SE now on paper SE stands for special edition still according to an old philler quote but the truth is this is the least special phone that Apple makes so I propose a new name for this one unofficially let's just call it the simple Edition cuz that's what it is the iPhone SE formula is and has been simple new chip old body low price so the ingredients this year are the a15 bionic same chip that's in the iPhone 13s in the body of an iPhone 8 again with its uh old design and home button and everything and $429 price tag now last generation this formula I said it was a hit right but now it's 2 years later and competition's sort of catching up a little bit more it's not as obvious of a huge winner as it's been in the past especially because the price did go up a little bit but in a world of the budget phone with the high refresh rate display versus the budget phone with the big battery or the budget phone with a stylus or the one with quad cameras this one has got something all the rest of them don't have which is it's the budget phone that's an iPhone here's my take though this is and always has been a very unbalanced phone like this has got parts that would humiliate other $400 phones but then other parts that are are starting to fall behind those phones like putting an a15 bionic in the iPhone SE means that this $400 phone has a more powerful chip than the $1,300 Galaxy s22 Ultra basically it has the most powerful chip in any phone right now alongside the flagship iPhone 13 and 13 Pro that is clearly more power than the typical iPhone SE buyer is going to need and it flies through iOS on a 720p display with no hiccups that's no surprise it feels like putting way too much engine in a tiny car but the reason for doing this is the same as it always has been which is it's got head room for days this phone is going to perform the same way it does today as it does in 2 years as it does in four five maybe six years and that is a priority for an iPhone SE buyer which is the longevity the software updates this is probably the longest lasting $400 phone period and then of course there's a bunch of other benefits to adding this newest chip this phone has 5G now not millimeter wave but sub 65g which is the most common kind and probably will be for a couple years and then just better overall efficiency although I'll get to this phone's battery life in a second and it now also has the New Image signal processor in the a15 so it can get a little more out of the exact same camera hardware and by the way there is one more gig of ram in here than the last SC so 4 gigs of RAM it's basically an iPhone 13 as far as performance goes but then let's talk about that camera on the back right cuz that's the one other thing that is just it's in a league of its own it's miles ahead of other $400 phones so it's it's just a single camera on the back 12 megapixels as far as I can tell it's the exact same camera Hardware again as the iPhone 8 and the last SE and the fact is it's just straight up the best single camera in this range it's the most consistent it's the best with color and noise management it doesn't have as much a natural background blur as the others with bigger sensors but it also doesn't have as much fringing and then the a15 bionic is giving you deep Fusion in medium dim lighting and smart HDR 4 in high dynamic range situations you have the new photographic Styles feature that builds the different looks straight into the image processing pipeline so basically if you thought the iPhone 8 photos were good this will also be good now you know when I'm shooting with it yeah I do miss not having an ultra wide sometimes and there are some instances where I really wish I could hit like a 2X button and just get a little bit of optical zoom going but at the same time I have to remember almost nobody getting this phone will have ever experienced that stuff in the past so they won't really know what they're missing oh also this is the best video camera in any $400 phone hands down it bumps up to 4K 60 this time great autofocus all the same great color and stuff I was talking about the one thing that's missing from this camera still night mode you would think with an a15 bionic they could finally get night mode into an iPhone SE camera but that's still not here but the point is you can see where I'm going with this right world class chip with excellent performance and Longevity and an amazing camera probably the best in any budget phone alongside the pixel 5A and then everything else about this phone is from the iPhone 8 that that phone came out in 2017 so it's uh looking a little long in the tooth as they say like it's just not very balanced now it's not that there's things that are bad about this phone it's just that they're so locked into this formula this exact formula like the newer iPhone 13 mini is smaller than this phone but it has a 5.4 in display right this iPhone 8 body is pretty small and trim by today's standards but when you turn it around you got those bezels and the chin and you just crunch down to a much smaller 4.7 in display and that display is like I said barely above 720p resolution it's 60 HZ it maxes out at a not very bright 600 nits so the whole front of this phone just feels so incredibly outdated you know you look at the other $400 phones now and they're trying to give you much larger displays thinner bezels lots of them are doing 90 or 120 HZ refresh rates now no problem but hey that's not Apple's formula they stick with the iPhone 8 body exactly and what can fit in this body exactly you know almost all of the competitive phones in this price have multiple cameras at least an ultrawide right that's not the iPhone su's formula the iPhone 8 had one camera the last iphone SE had one camera so yeah this one also is going to have one camera and on top of that you know lots of competitive budget phones are jamming impressively massive batteries in there 4, 4500 literally 5,000 milliamp hours plus sometimes and the single biggest concern with the last iphone SE was battery life right so Apple did hear that a little bit they did take improved battery chemistry and fit a slightly higher capacity battery in this same body but generally it still behaves pretty much the same way so we know a15 bionic is a very efficient chip it did great in this phone with standby time and those efficiency cores really go to work when you're doing that lightweight stuff the web browsing messaging reading the stuff most iPhone SE users do plenty of but if you do fire up a high brightness navigation app or if you jump into a game or just use the phone a lot then this is it's still a flagship chip you can still burn through battery really quickly with all that power so I could get to the end of the day like knowing what I was doing but I still did notice like when I fired this up and navigated to work 30-minute Drive with way on 10% battery gone like if I just used if I was in a game like asphalt for a little while I could notice it turning down battery and I killed this phone more than once by 900 p.m. and then because of this formula this phone still maxes out at 20 WS of fast charging so it'll fill up 0 to 100 in like an hour and it still only has 7 and 1 12 Watts Max of wireless charging I would actually recommend leaving on Smart data mode on this phone which will automatically turn off 5G when you don't need it because that can help save a little bit of juice but overall yeah this phone's battery life is still not great it's barely average so yeah world class is the chip the camera and the haptics and then below average is everything else so that's it's very similar to the last year or the 2020 iPhone SE which by the way I held up next to this phone you can barely tell the difference other than a slightly different color we got a bit of a deeper red this year and then also instead of black and white it's Starlight and midnight this time but basic the number one thing I found myself wondering when using this phone is what if they weren't so locked into this formula like this phone starts at 429 bucks I'm guessing the price is a little higher because of 5G but let's call it $400 right uh $50 extra gives you 128 gigs of storage because this only starts at 64 and we know that they can make a phone this cheap because they're using this exact same body that they have been able to mass produce for so long that the price has gone down but if they wanted to change something about it like adding a camera hole or changing something about it that would mean new research new tooling new manufacturing processes spinning up and that would bump up the price but by how much cuz I kind of still want to see it like I would argue that a a crappy 120 HZ display which you see in all kinds of other budget phones would make this iPhone feel faster for the life of the phone but they're not going to do that cuz they've still got this panel that they've gotten since the beginning of time and we also know that those those obnoxiously thick 4 5,000 Mah batteries would obviously make this phone last much longer but you'd have to make the phone thicker and that would increase the price but by how much like clearly they could use more battery or even tossing it an ultra wide just because every other phone seems to have that Ultra wide camera I missed it I think other people who are shopping with other phones will notice this doesn't have one but that would mean cutting another camera hole and that's a whole new design that costs more money but how much more maybe you can still do it but really I'm just going to have to wonder that forever because this seems to be the only way Apple knows how to make a cheaper phone it's boring it's predictable but it's simple and you know exactly what you're getting and not getting because basically it's happened before now all that being said this is still actually a very easy iPhone to recommend because it's the cheapest new iPhone and it's going to get the software updates for the longest time the natural considerations that kept coming up we talked about this at the studio is what about iPhone 11 right and iPhone 11 it won't have 5G but it will have a bigger display thinner bezels face ID better battery life and it'll be about a 100 bucks more and there's also iPhone 13 mini which is going to be a bigger display thinner bezels face ID better battery life and has 5G and the newest chip but it's like $300 more but neither of those have something this phone has which is the home button and that sounds crazy and it might be a surprise but a lot of people still really just want a home button never underestimate the power of the home button so at the end of the day I'm glad the iPhone SE just got any update at all cuz that's better for people getting this phone now into the future old dog new trick thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace [Music]","I've had the iPhone SE since in 2023, and I can say it's a good enough phone, but there ARE definitely some software issues (e.g. if you access the calculator from the home screen, it displays the header twice and misaligned). So, it does feel like a bit of a bastard child. I think phrasing it as the simple edition (as you said in your new iPhone 16e video) would make more sense, and maybe shift the philosophy and approach to development. 

But that being said, for a regular user, I'm happy with the battery. The night mode thing would be great, but I think it can be sacrificed. It'll be a good day when they're using the two-lens bodies for SE's.

And yes don't underestimate the power of a home button! The second iPhone releases a line with the full display AND a finger print capabilities again, I'm there. Other, cheaper phones have figured out touch ID and face ID, but iPhone continues to the buck against that trend. I get why, and I'm def a minority, but the home button is still a great feature. | The only use I see for these phones are for delivery drivers and cab drivers just for navigation. Simply to run a few apps. | I'm here from the future, with the newly released iphone SE 2025... RIP to the home button......................for now. | Just bought it for 200 Euro. I switch from the iPhone 7 to this, because more Apps doesn't support IOS 15 anymore... | wait ya'll can't be serious about the iphone SE ever being ""good"" | Hey Marcus. Any updates on the SE 4? I'm anticipating it | It's like a iPod touch with phone included | Here’s what I have to say. Were this close to the release date of the SE4 and we don’t know anymore than rumors the price is not gonna be very competitive and the price of the SE three is still 429 which I think is ridiculous when we’re that close to the release date of the SE four and Apple refuses to drop the price Because of the price not being very competitive on the SE four I probably will not be buying one because they’re pricing it out of a budget priced phone. I would rather have another SE3 but because the SE four is this close to coming out I would not want an SE three for 429. I would think 329 would be a better price But they’re not going to do that so I’m going to have to milk my SE three for as long as I can because I’m not gonna buy an SE four because they priced it out of the price friendly budget I would rather have another iPhone SE three than the SE four if Apple would still make it available and drop the price to at least 329 if they would do that I would buy one and stick with the SE three because that would be more budget friendly than the SE four but Apple‘s not gonna do any of this The ones that like the SE three are gonna get screwed and they’re gonna force everybody to believe that the SE four and its price is gonna be budget friendly when it’s really not they’re gonna still price people out and there’s gonna be people that will have to go to android because the SE four was priced out of a friendly budget and Apple is not gonna change anything because right now Apple is full of crap | Larry Henderson   se   phone | Crap battery back up.

CMm7UZKtGNk,NEW Mac Studio &amp; Apple Event Reactions!,"The Mac Studio, The iPhone SE 2022, and the Studio Display have arrived. I have some thoughts. Giveaway - You in yet?",2022-03-09T01:49:23Z,3129753,133463,6865,[Music] hey what's up mkbhd here and what a day to be a video creator in a studio also if you're wondering about this shirt you can get it at shop.mkbhd.com but also if you want to try your hand at a free one well currently the biggest tech giveaway of all time is going on right now a collaboration with me mr who's the boss and dbrand there's literally dozens of iphones and galaxy s 22 ultras and ps5s and nintendo switches and more and there are some shirts in there with all that tech too link below if you want to enter so today apple announced a bunch of new stuff some of which is kind of boring but some of which is really interesting here so the beginning of the event was pretty chill they dropped an apple tv plus announcement with some exclusive friday night baseball games meh i don't really watch that much baseball so yeah kind of boring then they drop some new colorways for the iphone 13 so there's a new solid green 13 and uh alpine green 13 pro so that's fine you know they already have a red so they couldn't add that as the mid-cycle refresh but green cool got it and then we got the iphone se refresh that we were all expecting this is the budget iphone and apple absolutely followed the same formula they typically do so they put the new chip in here it's the same a15 bionic that's in the iphone 13 and in the old body which in this case is still the iphone 8. they also give it 5g sub 6 only so no millimeter wave and that's it so that's that's the iphone se i mean they did so the new chip gives it a deep fusion gives it hdr4 gives it the new photographic styles and they did also throw in a slightly larger battery so that's all good but no surprises at all here it's kind of funny the se and iphone sc used to well it stands for special edition but honestly this is the most formulaic boring non-special phone that apple makes and then the price they dropped is actually slightly higher than last year it's 429 instead of 399. still probably one of the best budget phones in its general class that's giving you the best performance and one of the best cameras so i'll probably still review it if you guys are interested there's a lot of competition at that price so it won't be easy to win it but that's the iphone se and then the ipad air also got an update same body and design as before but now there's an m1 chip inside now apple's been way ahead in the tablet performance and packaging for a while and this is just another example of that this will be an absurdly fast chip the fastest in any tablet and it's in the package of an ipad air now for 5.99 plus they also updated the selfie camera to the 12 megapixel ultra wide with center stage it also gets 5g and it's got a thunderbolt port now because of m1 and it added a new blue color as far as i can tell that's that's it everything else is the same same battery same display same fingerprint reader same design all that and they mentioned they wanted to keep making steps forward on their commitment to the environment so they're using recycled design i mean sorry recycled aluminum recycled aluminum in this thing um i'm still mad they haven't added final cut pro to the ipad yet this thing is so powerful and still i mean imovie is fine but like come on add final cut pro cowards but then we got to the real meat of the presentation the unveiling of the new mac studio with m1 ultra chip and a new studio display now this this is interesting to me not just because we have a youtube channel called the studio make sure you get subscribed to that and not just because the studio dog's name is mac so we already have a studio mac but yeah this particular machine feels so perfectly targeted it's clearly built for someone like me oh are you a creative professional in a studio okay so yeah this is this is for you you've got my attention so this all starts with the new chip that's inside that they announced which is called the m1 ultra so basically you can think of this as two m1 max chips fused together i mean technically speaking that's not that far off so a single m1 max by itself that chip in the highest end macbook pro that's already crushing was the largest and most powerful chip apple ever made this m1 ultra i guess shout out to samsung for the ultra name behaves like a single massive chip literally 2.5 terabytes per second of bandwidth between the two halves of the chip and then 800 gigs per second of memory bandwidth for the whole combined thing but the whole thing has 64 or 128 gigs of unified memory it has a 20 core cpu with 16 of those being high performance cores for high efficiency and with a 48 core or 64 core gpu so that's good stuff that's good stuff it's the new biggest most powerful chip apple's ever made that lives at the top of their lineup and the only machine that they announce that will have this new m1 ultra chip inside it is the new mac studio so this thing is uh it's in the shape of a mac mini if the mac mini ate a lot of extra maybe it ate another mac mini i don't know basically it's roughly the same 7x7 footprint but it's much thicker it's a whole 3.7 inches tall so still small enough to fit under most monitors but if you have a ruler or something or if you happen to know exactly how big 3.7 inches is you know you can see that's pretty tall and can fit on most desks but honestly this is a fascinating design basically it has all these perforations at the bottom where it's sucking in fresh cold air and then basically half the internal volume of this thing is for cooling there's a bunch of fans in the top and it's pushing that hot exhaust air out of the top half of the back of it now i'm no expert but i'm just looking at the thing and it looks like it has enough cooling but also it worries me just a little bit just a little bit because it reminds me kinda of the old trashcan mac pro so you remember that thing also had the cool air coming in the bottom all the components in the middle and then the cooling out the fans at the top but i'm thinking apple's learned their lesson from that machine especially because now this is after all their own silicon instead of hot intel chip and huge dedicated gpu but yeah i'm just saying that's a lot of power in a pretty compact box basically but then last but not least there's the new studio display so they dropped a 27-inch 5k display that looks like a junior version of the pro display xdr just minus the whole xdr thing basically so it's got a couple different stand adjustments and i'll get to the pricing of all the stuff in a second it has a nano texture glass option and there's a webcam and speakers in there the webcam is familiar once again it's a 12 megapixel ultrawide camera with center stage built in a triple mic array and a six speaker setup that supports dolby atmos and spatial audio so okay for my take so on the chip i am very impressed i mean i definitely want to get it in here in our studio and do our benchmarking and testing because apple did show a bunch of graphs again as they usually do but they cycled through them very quickly and a lot of them weren't super useful but it basically looked like they did most of their comparisons against the old imac pro which is no longer on their site anymore rip and then against the current intel mac pro tower which you still can technically buy but definitely shouldn't so on paper they're just going to brag about performance per watt right so they're saying it uses less power than this core i5 and better cpu performance than a core i9 12 900 k at the same power consumption and it can deliver the same performance at 100 watts less power which is great for everybody's electricity bill and for thermals and then of course they're saying it'll take way less power than an rtx 3060 ti and can take 200 watts less power than an rtx 3090 while delivering the same performance which sounds absolutely sick but i'm gonna be testing that for myself we gotta see so we'll have those machines in here sooner or later and make sure you get subscribed to see those videos when they come out but then as far as the max studio itself i'm very tempted or i should say i'm interested uh so this machine actually starts with the m1 max in it and that one starts at two thousand dollars but then they'll ship you the m1 ultra max studio that starts at four thousand dollars and that one has two thunderbolt ports on the front by the way instead of the two usbc if you get the m1 max and on apple's site you can spec it up to the 64 core gpu for a thousand bucks you can double that unified memory for 800 bucks and you can go up to eight terabytes of storage for a total max of eight thousand dollars which isn't actually that crazy but my main question and i tweeted this during the event is basically is this a mac mini pro or is it a mac pro mini and that's a real there's a real difference and that actually matters because if this new machine this mac studio outperforms the literal highest end 28 core mac pro then is this the end of the road is this the highest end machine that apple now needs to make to complete the transition of all the macs this will basically make it the new mac pro just happens to be small enough to fit on your desk but is totally capable of running a whole studio or even doing things that the current mac pro isn't doing it has double the media engine so it can now play back 18 streams of 8k prores 422 video like how could you possibly need more than that i'm looking at our i'm looking at the the intel mac pros over here with the 28 chord xeon chip and 768 gigs of ram and the vega 2 gpu and i'm like that that got to end of life pretty quickly it was pretty expensive but john turnes did say something at the very end of the presentation together with the studio display these products will empower users to create the studios of their dreams and to continue to change the world and they join the rest of our incredible mac lineup with apple silicon making our transition nearly complete with just one more product to go mac pro but that is for another day now back to tim uh and see that that actually answers the question see it's not a mac pro mini it's a mac mini pro it's a it's a small desktop computer that sits right on your desk on your mouse pad just like that and costs a tenth of the price of the big dog and just happens to be just as capable if not more capable because of the architecture but yeah it's it's clearly not the end of the line and there's still one more like there's a reason there's still a bunch of mac pro towers behind them in their labs and they're not all replaced with mac studios the tower form factor can still unlock the very highest end of power and modularity and what the mac is capable of so that'll have i guess a new chip we haven't even heard about yet and that's the one i'm going to keep waiting for although clearly the new mac studio maxed out should be totally capable of handling everything we do here in this studio now the studio display stan included starts at 15.99 it's an extra 300 for the nano texture coating and an extra 400 to make that stand height adjustable which is kind of crazy now there is a lot of talk about whether or not this is actually a good price for this monitor overall and i think the reason that's actually kind of hard to answer is there isn't really any other monitor out that's exactly like it so the way i kind of look at it it's like they it's if they took a 27-inch imac display and just popped the display out exact same panel same brightness same resolution same size and then just repackaged it and put a bunch of apple features around it so i mentioned the webcam with center stage you know other monitors have webcams and mics but not quite like this you know other monitors have speakers too but if the macbook pro speakers are anything to go by then these are probably pretty unique as well and then the monitor has a whole a13 bionic chip inside just to act as a super high powered image signal processor for that webcam to do noise cancellation on the microphones and for your three usb-c ports and one thunderbolt port around the back basically this is like everything the lg 5k ultra fine monitor ever wanted to be except that thing came out six years ago had basically the same specs but this is a much cleaner packaged much better looking you know first party version so i think if that's what you're looking for it's still pricey but it is pretty unique in that way you know it's not hdr it's not higher fresh rate there's lots of things that it isn't but you know it'll pair well with basically any mac and that's what it does well that makes it so good but so that that's it there you have it those are my reactions honestly get subscribed to this channel if you want to see the evaluations in the machines as they come in and get subscribed to the studio channel if you want to see my reactions to the events sort of in real time and as we evaluate them when they show up here those videos are always really fun either way that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys soon peace [Music],"Fact correction: The new M1 iPad Air has a USB-C port, but not thunderbolt!

-EZ_3Tq9a8c,Dope Tech: Weirdest Earbuds I&#39;ve Ever Tried!,Enter the giveaway by following at the links below! Twitter: ✓ https://twitter.com/Mrwhosetheboss ✓ https://twitter.com/dbrand ...,2022-03-02T21:33:32Z,2944741,126118,3693,[Music] all right what's up MKBHD here welcome back to dope Tech and yes this is an Xbox series s fully portable in the shape of a laptop with a display on it and everything this is sent to me by the creators of the X screen and for a certain group of people this is really cool so obviously handheld gaming is having a bit of a moment right now I am also currently testing this little guy called the valve steam deck you might have heard about it uh leave a thumbs up if you're excited for that video but this thing well this is exactly what it looks like it's called The X screen for Xbox series s and it basically turns the console into a laptop form factor for your hardcore Gamers that want to play Xbox games but not just on the couch so basically all you have to do is plug it in by connecting this piece to the Xbox like a puzzle piece it has a USB plug and an HDMI plug in the back and you plug them in to line the whole thing up and then there's two bonus little thumb screws one on either side to help hold everything in place place and then you use literally the original cable that came with the Xbox and then boom the whole thing can light up just like this the screen turns on and you're gaming on the go now this screen it's not the highest end screen in the world on paper like the numbers it's an 11.6 in diagonal screen and it's 1080p it's an IPS at 60 HZ right but it matches the size of the Xbox obviously to achieve this form factor and then if you think about it 1080p right so that the screen you might be already gaming on for a console like this is 1080p but this is obviously way smaller so it's actually significantly sharper the higher pixel density and so you can sit much closer to it like I am here and so it's really just about convenience to match the size of the Xbox it's got the stereo speakers up top it also has an optional stand mode to help you get a better angle and it's got a Crosshair mode to help you better aim in shooter games if you're into that you basically just have to plug it in and light it up and it starts gaming so yeah you know it's not a 4K or 120 HZ screen or anything like that but I wasn't really expecting that much from something that plugs directly into an Xbox and you know what it still does have this nice matte finish which makes it easy to see in a variety of lighting situations it might face the audio gets surprisingly loud honestly it's easy to have a lot of fun playing this almost anywhere that you could fit a normal or super thick gaming laptop well except for the fact that you do pretty much always need to be plugged in I did see a video on the creators YouTube channel where they have this massive 99 Wat battery and so you could in theory bring it and the battery on a flight you know get that seat back trade table going but it lasts about 40 minutes so if you have the seat on a plane with no Outlet this isn't exactly great but overall you know aside from the rear USB and ethernet ports being blocked and the white color not quite exactly matching up the same as the Xbox plastic but being really close uh this thing is really well built and it's 250 bucks for the whole kit so so it's on Kickstarter right now that's basically the same price as the Xbox series s is going for it's a little bit pricey but I'll say if you have the outlet in the back of your car and you want to play Xbox games on the go like this is yeah this is the best way to actually do that until maybe of course Tesla finally ships that gaming feature they've been promising for so long so overall I'm going to give this 7 out of 10 if it's actually shipping and people are playing Xbox games on the go that's pretty dope all right these might be the strangest but coolest earbuds design I've ever seen these are called Sony link buds they're brand new you might have seen me tweet about them the other day and right away you can tell they're uh pretty different from normal earbuds you're seeing things correctly the earbud is a circle the part that actually goes into your ear is a circle I'll explain so a lot of the headphones we use right now have active noise cancellation but then a separate feature that they started adding more and more often which is some sort of transparency mode so uses the microphones around the earbud to pump in sound from the outside so you can walk around on the streets and still hear the cars around you or hear when your bus or train stop gets called so these well these are designed so you can always hear your environment around you even when you're wearing them so they have an 11 mm circular driver and a hole in the middle so when you put the earbuds in without playing any music you can still hear a lot of the outside world around you then when you play music well yeah it sounds like the headphones are on with a transparency mode now I found it's not actually as good as say airpods Pro because those microphones are actually amplifying your environment so with these you know if there's music playing you still hear a little bit of what's around you but you can actually drown it out if you turn the volume up loud enough but I really have been impressed with how well these actually work I mean clearly the physics makes sense there's a hole through it but yeah now you're letting in constantly a non-adjustable amount of sound from the outside world so it's great for listening to music while cars are around you or on public transportation so you can still hear when your bus stop gets haul or something like that it's consistent so then the idea with these is even when you're done using them done listening to music or taking a phone call or whatever it is you're doing you can just leave them in your ears because you'll have transparency mode you'll have the ability to hear what's going on around you all the time even when the earbuds are in and it doesn't take extra battery power to do that so now you're just having a normal conversation now the other thing you may have noticed is these earbuds are pretty tiny like the buds themselves are very small and the recycled plastic case they fit in as a result is also very pocketable but the downside is that there's no space on the buds themselves for media controls anywhere but that's where the second crazy feature comes into play you can adjust volume by tapping the skin around your ears so the the Sony Connect app lets you program a double tap or a triple tap of your own skull on the right or left hand side and these earbuds are sensitive enough of their own position that you can map a double tap on the right hand side to be volume a double tap on the left hand side could be skipping tracks or even opening Google assistant or accepting a phone call it's awesome overall as crazy as these are they are surprisingly usable they're 179 bucks um small case no wireless charging but it does have USB type-c and it gives you a file hour total battery life with these sound quality is solid if anything it's lacking a little bit of Base cuz it's not getting into your ear like normal earbuds might but yeah if you can get the touch controls to work well they're finicky sometimes but you got to tap like right up next to your ear uh they're pretty cool I'm going to give these an eight out of 10 okay this next product I know is absolutely not meant for me but I can still respect it anyway this is a super high-end gaming tablet and I just need you to know that this is real and this is something that actually exists so this is the Asus Rog flow z13 this thing has an up to 14 core Intel Core I9 processor a GeForce RTX 350 TI graphics card a 1080p 120 HZ display or a 4K 60 HZ option up to 1 tbte of m.2 SSD storage and a vapor chamber cooling solution on the back so yes it's a full-fledged gaming computer running Windows you can think of it kind of like a Surface Pro but just way more gaming focused now I can't imagine battery life will be killer on something like this most of the time but hey gaming laptops don't typically have amazing battery life either so that's not a huge surprise I'm just I'm really into this design though the Aesthetics of how they managed to shove all that power into a tablet size package it's got some thickness to it of course and it's definitely not like weight but you know it's a reasonable layout there's a power button and volume rockers on the right side along with a combo microphone headphone jack and a speaker at the bottom and then there's a single USB type-c Thunderbolt port on the left side along with this labeled xgm Port which is going to let you plug in different external gpus there's pins and magnets at the bottom for docking a keyboard accessory just like the surface and there's no ports up top but just heat dissipation just heat sinks heat radiating out the top and look at that LEDs PC B and the angular cutout in the kickstand that is a really nice touch and I'm not just saying that cuz it's red and black although that certainly helps but they've made as many clever incisions for ventilation and angular gamer aesthetic as possible and they seem to have gotten away with it now the 3050 TI isn't the highest end graphics card in the world I get that if you want to play The Witcher 3 or cyberpunk or something like that on high settings you're going to need more power probably something in a laptop form factor but that's why this thing can plug into those external GPU attachments the same stuff that the Rog flow thin and light laptop could plug into cuz this is meant to actually game on you should definitely watch Dave 2D's full video on it he gets 120 FPS on this tablet in OverWatch it's a tablet it's hilarious I'll link it below so the thing is a tablet when you want it to be but can plug into this rogg XG mobile Graphics doc which gives you up to an RTX 3080 basically you're buying a gaming laptop in two parts if that makes sense but I keep coming back to everything I like about just the back of this tablet the subtle texture of the metal The Rock Solid stand with this window cutout and under the kickstand there's a bunch of outlines giving you a Peak at what's inside so the m.2 SSD the battery and of course an opening to a Micro SD card slot there's also a set of coordinates on the back which if you Google them appears to direct you to asus's headquarters in Taiwan best part though they still included the camera on the back cuz somewhere out there there's somebody who would spend a bunch of money there isn't even a price for this thing yet but a bunch of money probably on a super high-end gaming tablet but still would take pictures with it anyway I'm giving this thing like a n out of 10 just for the aesthetic I'm a huge fan but then last thing I want to mention this USBC power cable with the display readout on the end has been awesome so basically ever since I showed it in my everyday carry video I've been carrying it and it's lowkey just like nerdy pretty fun to just be able to plug in and see exactly what sort of wattage you're getting from your charger on any device you know we always talk about Peak charging versus actual overall average charging rates this is so obviously unnecessary in Overkill but being able to see exactly what type of power you're drawing at any given moment maybe it's 30 Watts maybe it's 22 maybe it's your laptop you're pulling over a 100 from low battery I don't know it's just so entertaining now the thing about this every time I link it anywhere it sells out so I'm trying to do my best to keep an updated Link in the description for wherever I can find it in stock I'll do that again with this video but no promises if you want this you'll probably have to act pretty fast good luck okay really truly last but not least as a reward for making it this far into the video giveaway time what better way to cap it off so I'm teaming up with Aaron from Mr who's the boss who just recently hit 10 million subscribers huge shout out to him and congrats it's incredible Milestone and we're also going to be teaming up with dbrand the logistics Kings in Tech that make this all possible and why not just do a massive giveaway to celebrate it all and by Massive giveaway I mean possibly the biggest Tech giveaway of all time so up for grabs is 10 iPhone 13 Pro Maxes all with matte black dbrand skins applied 10 Samsung Galaxy s22 Ultras all with the new Atomic grip case which is super
